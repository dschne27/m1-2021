The snow stuck to everything, with the weight of the snow downing many, many trees and power lines.  Power outages were widespread, with an outright majority of Northern Michigan residents losing power at some time during or after the storm.  In Benzie County, 95 percent of residents lost power.  Outages lasted up to a week in some spots.  Great Lakes Energy described it as the worst snowstorm (in regards to power outages) in 30 years.  A number of counties and communities opened shelters to aid those without power or heat.  Also included in the tree damage was substantial damage to fruit trees in the Grand Traverse Bay region, particularly cherry trees.
