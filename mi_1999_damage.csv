However, snow was not nearly as heavy as on the 2nd and 3rd, and most of the heavy snow on the 4th occurred across the lakeshore counties.     Overall, this winter storm ended up being one of the strongest to affect western lower Michigan in 2 decades, and came to be known as the ""Blizzard of '99"".      Several areas of low pressure began to consolidate just to the northwest of Amarillo, Texas, on the morning of January 1st.  By the early morning hours of January 2nd, the low had intensified and moved to the western Tennessee Valley   Snow and very strong east to southeast winds preceded the system across lower Michigan.  A deep upper level trough was carved out over the nations mid section, and an upper level low was centered over the Plains states.     All of southern lower Michigan was affected by blizzard conditions at times on January 2nd.  Snow began in the morning and continued through the afternoon, making travel difficult to impossible.  Wind gusts of 45 to as high as 65 mph in Muskegon (Muskegon County) produced sporadic power outages, mainly along the lakeshore, and occasional whiteout conditions.       By the evening hours of  the 2nd, 6 to 12 inches of snow had already fallen across southwest and west central lower Michigan, with both Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties reporting up to a foot of new snow by 10 pm.       The surface low pressure system continued to intensify and move to the north northeast over Indiana, and on up into Michigan, and was centered near Gaylord, in northern lower Michigan, by the morning of the 3rd.  The upper level low deepened as well, and drifted very slowly to the east over Wisconsin.  Thus began the second phase of the snowstorm across western lower Michigan, marked by bands of heavy lake effect snow, and continued blowing and drifting.  The snow continued through the 3rd and 4th, and even lingered into the early morning hours of the 5th before finally tapering to flurries.         Travel through the period ranged from difficult to impossible, due to all the blowing and drifting of snow, and occasional whiteout conditions.

The surface low pressure system continued to intensify and move to the north northeast over Indiana, and on up into Michigan, and was centered near Gaylord, in northern lower Michigan, by the morning of the 3rd.  The upper level low deepened as well, and drifted very slowly to the east over Wisconsin.  Thus began the second phase of the snowstorm across western lower Michigan, marked by bands of heavy lake effect snow, and continued blowing and drifting.  The snow continued through the 3rd and 4th, and even lingered into the early morning hours of the 5th before finally tapering to flurries.         Travel through the period ranged from difficult to impossible, due to all the blowing and drifting of snow, and occasional whiteout conditions.  Some snow drifts measured to 5 to 6 feet in open rural areas.  Roads became impassable and many highways and rural roads were closed through the 4th.  There were several car accidents through the period.  Most schools were closed, some for over a week in rural areas.  Most colleges and universities, as well as quite a few area businesses, were closed on the 4th and 5th as well.  The following is a list of final snow storm total snowfalls for the 2nd through the 5th:35 inches in Grand Haven (Ottawa County), 28 inches in Holland (Allegan County), 25 inches in Bloomingdale (Van Buren County), 25 inches in Glenn (Allegan County), 24 inches at the Kalamazoo Nature Center (Kalamazoo County), 23 inches in Grandville (Kent County), 22 inches in Grand Rapids (Kent County), 22 inches in Wayland (Allegan County), 19 inches in Hastings (Barry County), 18 inches in Sparta (Kent County), 18 inches at Gull Lake (Kalamazoo County), 16 inches at Watervliet (Van Buren County), 16 inches in Jackson (Jackson County), 16 inches in Ionia (Ionia County), 16 inches in Newaygo (Newaygo County), 16 inches at Hesperia (Oceana/Newaygo County), 16 inches in Ludington (Mason County), 14 inches at the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport (Kalamazoo County), 14 inches in Big Rapids (Mecosta County),  14 inches across Osceola County, 13 inches in St. Johns (Clinton County), 13 inches in Battle Creek (Calhoun County), 13 inches in Pentwater (Oceana County), 13 inches across Lake County, 12 inches in Eaton Rapids (Eaton County), 12 inches in Lansing (Ingham County), 12 inches in Vestaburg (Montcalm/Gratiot County), and 12 inches across Clare and Isabella Counties.",,1999,1

Several of the storms became severe during the late afternoon and evening hours.The first few severe storms of the day were in the Saginaw Bay area, and produced large hail.  The largest hail (golfball sized) fell in Port Hope.As thunderstorm activity gradually migrated south, large hail reports became less frequent.  The largest hail in the southern part of the area was quarter sized near Saline.  However, these southern storms produced stronger wind gusts.  The highest measured wind gusts were 54 mph at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and 51 mph at the airport in Owosso.  However, winds were estimated much higher in some locations.  The highest estimated gusts were near 90 mph just east of Deckerville.The most common effect of the severe wind gusts was to down trees and power lines.  Power lines were downed across Interstate 94 near Dexter, closing the freeway for a short while.  A few agricultural outbuildings were destroyed just northwest of Oakley, just south of Sandusky, and east of Deckerville.  Windows were blown out of a Marlette home, while a home in Northville lost a number of shingles.  In Ortonville, the roof was torn off a dugout at a ball field, and a home had a falling tree go through its roof.  A tree was felled onto a Sandusky home, heavily damaging a porch; just south of town, a mobile home was shifted off its foundation.

Wind gusts of 45 to as high as 65 mph in Muskegon (Muskegon County) produced sporadic power outages, mainly along the lakeshore, and occasional whiteout conditions.       By the evening hours of  the 2nd, 6 to 12 inches of snow had already fallen across southwest and west central lower Michigan, with both Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties reporting up to a foot of new snow by 10 pm.       The surface low pressure system continued to intensify and move to the north northeast over Indiana, and on up into Michigan, and was centered near Gaylord, in northern lower Michigan, by the morning of the 3rd.  The upper level low deepened as well, and drifted very slowly to the east over Wisconsin.  Thus began the second phase of the snowstorm across western lower Michigan, marked by bands of heavy lake effect snow, and continued blowing and drifting.  The snow continued through the 3rd and 4th, and even lingered into the early morning hours of the 5th before finally tapering to flurries.         Travel through the period ranged from difficult to impossible, due to all the blowing and drifting of snow, and occasional whiteout conditions.  Some snow drifts measured to 5 to 6 feet in open rural areas.  Roads became impassable and many highways and rural roads were closed through the 4th.  There were several car accidents through the period.  Most schools were closed, some for over a week in rural areas.  Most colleges and universities, as well as quite a few area businesses, were closed on the 4th and 5th as well.  The following is a list of final snow storm total snowfalls for the 2nd through the 5th:35 inches in Grand Haven (Ottawa County), 28 inches in Holland (Allegan County), 25 inches in Bloomingdale (Van Buren County), 25 inches in Glenn (Allegan County), 24 inches at the Kalamazoo Nature Center (Kalamazoo County), 23 inches in Grandville (Kent County), 22 inches in Grand Rapids (Kent County), 22 inches in Wayland (Allegan County), 19 inches in Hastings (Barry County), 18 inches in Sparta (Kent County), 18 inches at Gull Lake (Kalamazoo County), 16 inches at Watervliet (Van Buren County), 16 inches in Jackson (Jackson County), 16 inches in Ionia (Ionia County), 16 inches in Newaygo (Newaygo County), 16 inches at Hesperia (Oceana/Newaygo County), 16 inches in Ludington (Mason County), 14 inches at the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport (Kalamazoo County), 14 inches in Big Rapids (Mecosta County),  14 inches across Osceola County, 13 inches in St. Johns (Clinton County), 13 inches in Battle Creek (Calhoun County), 13 inches in Pentwater (Oceana County), 13 inches across Lake County, 12 inches in Eaton Rapids (Eaton County), 12 inches in Lansing (Ingham County), 12 inches in Vestaburg (Montcalm/Gratiot County), and 12 inches across Clare and Isabella Counties.",,1999,1

An associated cold front moved across southeast Michigan in the evening.  Numerous showers developed ahead of the cold front in lower Michigan.  Even though there was little, if any, thunder, these showers managed to produce two tornadoes in southeast Michigan.In Lenawee County, a tornado moved northeast across Rome Township.  This tornado produced F0 damage along most of its path, but briefly reached F1 intensity about 2 miles northeast of Rome Center.  At this point, the tornado destroyed a large metal shed, blowing debris up to a quarter mile away.  The tornado also damaged an antique gas pump at the same site.  Along the rest of its path, the tornado snapped off a number of trees, and damaged siding and rain gutters to a farmhouse.  Just before it lifted, the tornado shifted a barn off its foundation, and partially deroofed two barns.As an historical note, the path of this tornado coincided almost exactly with a segment of the paths of the Palm Sunday tornadoes of April 11 1965 - which were the strongest tornadoes in Lenawee County since 1950.  In fact, local property owners commented that the structures that were damaged by the 1999 tornado were also damaged (much more heavily) back in 1965!The second tornado of the day affected Imlay and Goodland Townships in eastern Lapeer County.  Just after touchdown, the tornado moved a two story home along Bowers Road off its foundation, resulting in serious structural damage.  A barn across the street was partially deroofed, and portions of the walls collapsed.  A livestock trailer and a dog pen were also moved, and a large tree was downed nearby.Damage was comparatively slight in the middle portion of the track.  Just before it lifted, however, the tornado struck another home, this one along Shaw Road.  This two-year-old home was largely deroofed, with pieces of the roof found a quarter mile away.

Even though there was little, if any, thunder, these showers managed to produce two tornadoes in southeast Michigan.In Lenawee County, a tornado moved northeast across Rome Township.  This tornado produced F0 damage along most of its path, but briefly reached F1 intensity about 2 miles northeast of Rome Center.  At this point, the tornado destroyed a large metal shed, blowing debris up to a quarter mile away.  The tornado also damaged an antique gas pump at the same site.  Along the rest of its path, the tornado snapped off a number of trees, and damaged siding and rain gutters to a farmhouse.  Just before it lifted, the tornado shifted a barn off its foundation, and partially deroofed two barns.As an historical note, the path of this tornado coincided almost exactly with a segment of the paths of the Palm Sunday tornadoes of April 11 1965 - which were the strongest tornadoes in Lenawee County since 1950.  In fact, local property owners commented that the structures that were damaged by the 1999 tornado were also damaged (much more heavily) back in 1965!The second tornado of the day affected Imlay and Goodland Townships in eastern Lapeer County.  Just after touchdown, the tornado moved a two story home along Bowers Road off its foundation, resulting in serious structural damage.  A barn across the street was partially deroofed, and portions of the walls collapsed.  A livestock trailer and a dog pen were also moved, and a large tree was downed nearby.Damage was comparatively slight in the middle portion of the track.  Just before it lifted, however, the tornado struck another home, this one along Shaw Road.  This two-year-old home was largely deroofed, with pieces of the roof found a quarter mile away.

Power lines and trees were downed on both sides of Eastman Avenue, although little damage was done to structures.  The tornado strengthened as it moved northeast across Woodpark Drive, uprooting trees, blowing out windows, and removing rain gutters and siding.  Some trees were downed onto nearby homes.  The tornado reached its maximum intensity as it crossed Wackerly Road.  It struck a Holiday Inn Convention Center, located between Wackerly Road and the US-10 freeway.  The roof of the convention center was blown off, with some debris blown across the freeway.  An air conditioner from the roof was tossed onto a nearby parked car.  Several doors to the convention center were blown out.  A trash can from the hotel area was blown onto US-10, where it struck a car.The tornado weakened as it crossed the US-10 freeway.  It moved through the parking lot of a Target store, at the southeast corner of Midland Mall.  An outdoor shopping cart holder was thrown into a nearby field, and several trees were destroyed.  As the tornado continued northeast, it downed a pair of large trees midway between a nursery and a WalMart.Toward the end of its path, the tornado struck a church on Jefferson Avenue, just south of Letts Road.  Large limbs were downed here, and siding was torn off some of the church buildings.  A youth center under construction was partially deroofed.This tornado tied for the strongest to strike Midland County since 1950.  The only previous F2 tornado occurred on April 14 1974.

The heat and humidity made the atmosphere very unstable, and allowed thunderstorms to develop in the afternoon.  Several of the storms became severe during the late afternoon and evening hours.The first few severe storms of the day were in the Saginaw Bay area, and produced large hail.  The largest hail (golfball sized) fell in Port Hope.As thunderstorm activity gradually migrated south, large hail reports became less frequent.  The largest hail in the southern part of the area was quarter sized near Saline.  However, these southern storms produced stronger wind gusts.  The highest measured wind gusts were 54 mph at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and 51 mph at the airport in Owosso.  However, winds were estimated much higher in some locations.  The highest estimated gusts were near 90 mph just east of Deckerville.The most common effect of the severe wind gusts was to down trees and power lines.  Power lines were downed across Interstate 94 near Dexter, closing the freeway for a short while.  A few agricultural outbuildings were destroyed just northwest of Oakley, just south of Sandusky, and east of Deckerville.  Windows were blown out of a Marlette home, while a home in Northville lost a number of shingles.  In Ortonville, the roof was torn off a dugout at a ball field, and a home had a falling tree go through its roof.

The strong wind throughout the storm made it very difficult to measure snowfall accurately.With temperatures in the teens across most of the area, the snow was very fluffy and dry - which is unusual for Michigan heavy snow events.  An exception occurred late in the evening of the 2nd, as a surge of warmer air struggled into extreme southeast Michigan. Temperatures rose to around freezing for a few hours, and some freezing rain occurred in Monroe County.  Thundersnow at the leading edge of warm air surge added to snowfall totals in the far southeast.

The storm was well advertised, and a run on grocery stores occurred early in the day.  Many stores ran out of staples like bread and milk.  Most businesses closed their doors early on the 2nd, to allow employees to get home while they still could.  After the snow, the run was on snow removal equipment, with snowblowers, shovels, and salt all very hard to find.  The weight of the snow tore a gash in the roof of the Pontiac Silverdome.  Festivities surrounding the inaugural of Governor John Engler were postponed.  Most schools closed the Monday and Tuesday after the storm (the 2nd was a Saturday), and some schools stayed closed for Wednesday as well.Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) was severely impacted by the storm.  DTW remained open on the 2nd, but visibility at DTW, combined with deteriorating conditions at other airports in the region, resulted in few (if any) incoming and outgoing flights from afternoon on.  After closing to clean the runways on the morning of the 3rd (a Sunday), DTW reopened to incoming flights.  Unfortunately, although the runways were clear, an insufficient number of arrival/departure gates were usable.  By the time this was realized, and incoming air traffic halted, close to 50 planes had landed at DTW without a place to disembark.  In an incident that received national media attention, some passengers were stranded in their planes for eight hours until they could disembark.  Full operations at DTW would not be resumed until the 6th.The heavy snow also focused media attention on the city of Detroit.  According to city policy, residential streets were not plowed after a heavy snow.  This resulted in effectively shutting down parts of the city for almost two weeks, as residents could not get out of their neighborhoods and onto the main streets.  Schools were closed for days, as students could not safely get to and from school.  In the wake of the storm, this snow-removal policy was being reassessed.",,1999,1

Snow developed over western lower Michigan, mainly west of US-131, during the late evening hours of the 5th in southwest flow out ahead of the Alberta Clipper.  The system moved through western lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 6th, bringing an end to the light snow out ahead of it.      However, behind the system, lake effect snow quickly developed as winds became west to northwest, ushering in much colder air over the relatively warm Lake Michigan waters.       The hardest hit areas were along the lakeshore, from South Haven (Van Buren County) up to Ludington (Mason County), where anywhere from 6 to as much as 9 inches of snow had fallen by the time snow ended late on the 6th.   2 to 9 inch snowfall amounts were common from US-131 west.  East of US-131, only an inch or two of snow fell as a result of the moisture associated out ahead of the Alberta Clipper, but no lake effect snow occurred. The following is a list of specific snowfall totals for late on the 5th through the 6th:9 inches in Muskegon (Muskegon County), 8 inches in Plainwell (Allegan County), 7 inches in Allegan (Allegan County), 6 inches in Grand Haven (Ottawa County), 6 inches in Grandville (Kent County), 6 inches in Kalamazoo (Kalamazoo County), 5 inches in Grand Rapids (Kent County).",,1999,1

By the middle of the month, snowfall was nearing historic proportions, with January of 1999 already among one of the snowiest months ever in southeast Michigan.  Compounding the problem was a sustained cold spell during the first half of the month, which prevented any of the snow from melting.  As the snowpack grew toward two feet deep across southeast Michigan, it became more and more difficult to find places to put additional snowfall.  In snowbound Detroit, the postal service took to delivering the mail via the ""Good Humor man"" method: the postal carrier would drive as close to his customers as he could, then honk his horn.  Residents were then to come out and get their mail.  Many Detroit residents had not received mail since before the January 2nd blizzard.Some roofs across the area gave way under the immense weight of the snow.  On the 12th, a portion of the roof collapsed at a shopping center in Canton Township (Wayne County); two stores were extensively damaged.  The roof of a welding company in Green Oak Township (Livingston County) also collapsed.  Additional snowfall that night caused several roof collapses on the 13th:  a light industrial firm in Detroit, which damaged a gas line and started a fire;  a bowling center in Commerce Township (Oakland County), where three people were injured;  a vacant commercial building in Ann Arbor;  a former lawn and garden store in Ypsilanti;  a light industrial firm in Novi; a wholesale store in Dearborn;  a train assembly building in Melvindale;  and a pizza parlor in Monroe County.  Also on the 13th, the roof of a two story office building in New Baltimore buckled.  On the 14th, a roof covering an outdoor pool collapsed in Hudson.Ice dams on roofs were another widespread problem.  Heat escaping from homes melted some of the snow on the roof; as the meltwater ran down to the eaves, it refroze, as the eaves were not heated from underneath.  Ice buildup on the eaves of roofs created ice dams; further meltwater had nowhere to go, and found its way through shingles and into ceilings.  Tens of thousands of buildings suffered leaks, resulting in a barrage of calls to both roofers and insurance agents.

Well to the north and northwest of the track of this system, very light snow and flurries developed across western lower Michigan on the 8th.  However, northwest winds in the wake of the system late on the 8th and on the 9th ushered in colder air across the relatively warm waters of Lake Michigan.  As a result, lake effect snow developed across all the lakeshore counties of western lower Michigan.

This low produced very heavy snow across most of the southern Great Lakes, and southeast Michigan was no exception.Snow developed from south to north across southeast Michigan during the daylight hours of the 2nd.  A combination of snow, blowing snow, and wind produced blizzard conditions across the metro Detroit area in the early afternoon.  The winds subsided slightly as the snow intensified, but near-blizzard conditions were the rule into the overnight hours.  The strong wind throughout the storm made it very difficult to measure snowfall accurately.With temperatures in the teens across most of the area, the snow was very fluffy and dry - which is unusual for Michigan heavy snow events.  An exception occurred late in the evening of the 2nd, as a surge of warmer air struggled into extreme southeast Michigan. Temperatures rose to around freezing for a few hours, and some freezing rain occurred in Monroe County.

President Clinton would eventually declare Lenawee, Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw, and Wayne Counties as federal disaster areas.All told, this was one of the worst snowstorms of the past 25 years, and the effects were far-reaching.  The storm was well advertised, and a run on grocery stores occurred early in the day.  Many stores ran out of staples like bread and milk.  Most businesses closed their doors early on the 2nd, to allow employees to get home while they still could.  After the snow, the run was on snow removal equipment, with snowblowers, shovels, and salt all very hard to find.  The weight of the snow tore a gash in the roof of the Pontiac Silverdome.  Festivities surrounding the inaugural of Governor John Engler were postponed.  Most schools closed the Monday and Tuesday after the storm (the 2nd was a Saturday), and some schools stayed closed for Wednesday as well.Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) was severely impacted by the storm.  DTW remained open on the 2nd, but visibility at DTW, combined with deteriorating conditions at other airports in the region, resulted in few (if any) incoming and outgoing flights from afternoon on.  After closing to clean the runways on the morning of the 3rd (a Sunday), DTW reopened to incoming flights.  Unfortunately, although the runways were clear, an insufficient number of arrival/departure gates were usable.  By the time this was realized, and incoming air traffic halted, close to 50 planes had landed at DTW without a place to disembark.  In an incident that received national media attention, some passengers were stranded in their planes for eight hours until they could disembark.  Full operations at DTW would not be resumed until the 6th.The heavy snow also focused media attention on the city of Detroit.  According to city policy, residential streets were not plowed after a heavy snow.  This resulted in effectively shutting down parts of the city for almost two weeks, as residents could not get out of their neighborhoods and onto the main streets.  Schools were closed for days, as students could not safely get to and from school.  In the wake of the storm, this snow-removal policy was being reassessed.",,1999,1

By the middle of the month, snowfall was nearing historic proportions, with January of 1999 already among one of the snowiest months ever in southeast Michigan.  Compounding the problem was a sustained cold spell during the first half of the month, which prevented any of the snow from melting.  As the snowpack grew toward two feet deep across southeast Michigan, it became more and more difficult to find places to put additional snowfall.  In snowbound Detroit, the postal service took to delivering the mail via the ""Good Humor man"" method: the postal carrier would drive as close to his customers as he could, then honk his horn.  Residents were then to come out and get their mail.  Many Detroit residents had not received mail since before the January 2nd blizzard.Some roofs across the area gave way under the immense weight of the snow.  On the 12th, a portion of the roof collapsed at a shopping center in Canton Township (Wayne County); two stores were extensively damaged.  The roof of a welding company in Green Oak Township (Livingston County) also collapsed.  Additional snowfall that night caused several roof collapses on the 13th:  a light industrial firm in Detroit, which damaged a gas line and started a fire;  a bowling center in Commerce Township (Oakland County), where three people were injured;  a vacant commercial building in Ann Arbor;  a former lawn and garden store in Ypsilanti;  a light industrial firm in Novi; a wholesale store in Dearborn;  a train assembly building in Melvindale;  and a pizza parlor in Monroe County.  Also on the 13th, the roof of a two story office building in New Baltimore buckled.  On the 14th, a roof covering an outdoor pool collapsed in Hudson.Ice dams on roofs were another widespread problem.  Heat escaping from homes melted some of the snow on the roof; as the meltwater ran down to the eaves, it refroze, as the eaves were not heated from underneath.  Ice buildup on the eaves of roofs created ice dams; further meltwater had nowhere to go, and found its way through shingles and into ceilings.  Tens of thousands of buildings suffered leaks, resulting in a barrage of calls to both roofers and insurance agents.  Leakage got into the Clements Library of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, damaging or destroying several rare maps and atlases.",,1999,1

Festivities surrounding the inaugural of Governor John Engler were postponed.  Most schools closed the Monday and Tuesday after the storm (the 2nd was a Saturday), and some schools stayed closed for Wednesday as well.Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) was severely impacted by the storm.  DTW remained open on the 2nd, but visibility at DTW, combined with deteriorating conditions at other airports in the region, resulted in few (if any) incoming and outgoing flights from afternoon on.  After closing to clean the runways on the morning of the 3rd (a Sunday), DTW reopened to incoming flights.  Unfortunately, although the runways were clear, an insufficient number of arrival/departure gates were usable.  By the time this was realized, and incoming air traffic halted, close to 50 planes had landed at DTW without a place to disembark.  In an incident that received national media attention, some passengers were stranded in their planes for eight hours until they could disembark.  Full operations at DTW would not be resumed until the 6th.The heavy snow also focused media attention on the city of Detroit.  According to city policy, residential streets were not plowed after a heavy snow.  This resulted in effectively shutting down parts of the city for almost two weeks, as residents could not get out of their neighborhoods and onto the main streets.  Schools were closed for days, as students could not safely get to and from school.  In the wake of the storm, this snow-removal policy was being reassessed.",,1999,1

The heaviest snow fell during the afternoon and evening hours of the 5th, into the early morning hours of the 6th.  By 7 am on the 6th, the low pressure system had moved up into Ohio.  With west to northwest winds behind the system, a little bit of lake effect snow continued on the 6th, though additional accumulations were light before the snow ended. The following is a list of final storm total snowfall amounts, broken down by county, for the 4th through the 6th:8 - 10 inches in Eaton County; 6 - 10 inches in Ingham County; 8 - 9 inches in Barry and Calhoun counties; 6 - 9 inches in Allegan and Ionia counties; 8 inches across Jackson County; 7 - 8 inches across Kalamazoo and Montcalm counties; 6 - 8 inches across Clinton, Gratiot, Kent, Lake, and Osceola counties; 5 - 8 inches across Van Buren County; 6 - 7 inches across Muskegon County; 5 - 7 inches across Newaygo County; 6 inches across Isabella County; 5 inches across Mecosta County; 4 inches across Ottawa County; 3 inches across Clare County; and 2 - 3 inches across Mason and Oceana counties.",,1999,3

However, temperatures were able to climb well into the 90s before the front arrived, with dew points in the middle to upper 70s.  Numerous severe thunderstorms developed along the front as it moved through, with most of the severe weather located south of Interstate 69.Only one storm produced severe criteria hail.  This occurred in Goodrich, where golfball sized hail fell.  Otherwise, damaging wind gusts were the severe weather threat.  Spotters reported 83 mph gusts just north of Avoca, 70 mph in Brighton and Redford, 60 mph in Saline, Allen Park, Macomb Township, and Rochester Hills, and 58 mph near Metamora.As is usually the case, the main result of these severe gusts was to down trees, tree limbs, and power lines.  The hardest hit community was Goodrich, where a garage was moved well off its foundation, a church steeple and a backyard pool were destroyed, and flying debris damaged siding.  In Pontiac, a toppled tree punched a hole in a home's roof, utility poles were snapped, and a large sign was tossed through the windows of an indoor flea market.  Siding was torn off a building in nearby Auburn Hills.  Cars were damaged by fallen trees in Royal Oak and Harrison Township (Macomb County).The number of severe thunderstorms from the 23rd through the 31st was unusually high.  Insurance companies stated that there were more damage claims from these late July storms than for any other single weather event since 1983.  State Farm Insurance alone reported 7500 damage claims in the entire state of Michigan, worth about $10 million.  Allstate reported about 1600 claims, and AAA of Michigan 2000 claims, with no dollar figures available.Area power companies came under some ""heat"" during this time period.  Severe weather, combined with high electric demand due to hot and humid weather, produced frequent and lengthy power outages in some locations.

Temperatures approached 90 degrees during the afternoon, with dew points as high as 80.  This resulted in a very unstable airmass across the area.  A trough of low pressure moved east into the western Great Lakes by late morning, and thunderstorms ignited along the trough.  These storms moved southeast into Michigan, and a large number of them became severe.The first severe report was dime sized hail in southwest Midland County.  That would be the only severe hail event; the rest of the day was filled with damaging wind gusts.  A 66 mph gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a spotter estimated 70 mph winds near downtown Detroit.Most the damage caused by the wind involved downed trees and power lines.  Trees were downed onto homes in the city of Midland, White Lake, Lake Orion, Pontiac, and Deerfield Township (Lapeer County).  Deerfield Township was especially hard hit, as some roads were closed for several days due to tree debris. A number of tents at the Ann Arbor Art Fair were demolished.  Vehicles were destroyed in White Lake and Port Huron when trees fell on them.  A large awning was blown off the roof of a Canton strip mall, and the roof of a hangar at the Oakland County International Airport in Waterford was displaced by the wind.  Panelling was torn off the press box at Tiger Stadium in Detroit.  In St Clair Shores, a garage collapsed, moored sailboats were tipped over, and part of an aluminum roof was peeled off a warehouse.Locally heavy rainfall occurred with some of the thunderstorms, especially in metro Detroit.  Freeway underpasses were flooded in Detroit, as were fifty basements in Dearborn.

Beachgoers at the park quickly gathered up their things and raced to their cars, but the last group off the beach was not quite quick enough.  Lightning struck an adult female and an eight year old girl, about five feet away from their car.  Rescue workers were briefly able to resuscitate the adult, but she died soon after arriving at a local hospital.  The girl was treated for her injuries at the hospital, and was released the following day.",1999,7
