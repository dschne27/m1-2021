Precipitation broke out across Southeast Michigan during the early morning hours of the 24th, spreading from south to north during the morning hours.  Temperatures were marginal for snow, but it was cold enough for mainly snow north and west of the glacial ridge.  To the south and east, including the city of Detroit, much of the precipitation fell as rain or a wintry mix, drastically reducing snowfall totals there.  The snowfall was heavy at times during the afternoon and evening hours north of a line from roughly Ann Arbor to Port Huron, with 1 inch per hour rates common.  The snowfall tapered off for a time overnight as the main precip shield was shunted to the west, but lingering moisture and forcing moved across Southeast Michigan once more during the morning hours of the 25th, adding a few more inches to storm totals. ||All told, the heaviest amounts from 12 to 14 inches occurred in a stripe across Lapeer County, southern portions of Shiawassee and Genesee Counties, and northern portions of Oakland and Livingston Counties.
