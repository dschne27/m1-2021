Due to strong winds, the greatest snow amounts were recorded further inland. Grand Rapids and Muskegon each broke one daily snowfall record during this period. The snow that fell during the cold air outbreak in the middle of the month accounted for the vast majority of the monthly totals. Grand Rapids received 31.0 inches of snow for November, eclipsing the previous record of 28.2 inches in 1895. Muskegon accumulated 24.5 inches, falling short of the 1995 record of 25.7 inches. Lansing had 6.2 inches, still above normal for the month but not even in the top ten snowiest Novembers.||Synoptic and lake effect snow continued November 17-21 and the snow was heavy at times, resulting in hazardous travel conditions through the week.  Total snowfall from November 13-21 reached 3 feet from north central Allegan county north to eastern Ottawa county.  Total snowfall reports in excess of 2 feet were common along the US-131 corridor.||November 2014 was a remarkable month for cold and snow. Temperatures across Southwest Lower Michigan averaged well below normal, snowfall was above to well above normal, and precipitation was near to above normal. Grand Rapids had their snowiest November on record while Muskegon had their second snowiest. A number of daily temperature, snowfall, and precipitation records were also set.",2014,1

During the course of the morning, northerly winds gusted between 35 to 45 mph, which caused a significant amount of blowing and drifting of the snow. These northerly winds also caused temperatures to plummet during the course of the afternoon. The rapid freezing of the heavy wet snow and blowing and drifting led to extremely poor road conditions throughout most of Southeast Michigan. The significant blowing and drifting of the snow made measuring very difficult. Snowfall accumulations generally ranged from 5 to 9 inches along and south of I-69 corridor, with isolated 10 inch amounts. Here are some of the higher snowfall reports received:||Fowlerville (3W) 10 inches.|Port Huron 10.0 inches.|Clarkston 9.3 inches.|Hollly 9.3 inches.|Mt. Clemens 8.9 inches.|Linden 8.8 inches.|Peck (2W) 8.0 inches.|Riverview 8.0 inches.|Perry 7.6 inches.|Monroe 7.2 inches.|Lum 6.5 inches.|Tecumseh 6.0 inches.|Ann Arbor 5.8 inches.",2014,3
