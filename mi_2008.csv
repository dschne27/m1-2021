Sparks from a passing train were a possible cause.  It was a warm, dry, windy day, and a Red Flag Warning was in effect.  The fire quickly expanded as it raced to the northwest, crossing I-75 by late afternoon between the Four Mile Road and I-75 Business Loop exits.  Eventually, 1300 acres were burned, and the fire threatened the Ramada Inn and Admiral gas station on the far south end of Grayling.  However, the only structures lost were about half a dozen cabins near the Simpson Lakes, about two miles south of downtown Grayling.  Damage at the Grayling Game Club was near $287,000.  In addition, a State of Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) transport truck, used to bring bulldozers to the fire line, was claimed by the fire.  Total cost of the fire to the DNR was $619,000.  This included both the cost of suppressing the fire, and damage done to timber and the transport.  (Note that fire suppression costs are not considered damages done by the fire.)  Power was lost in Grayling, fifty homes were evacuated, and I-75 was closed for several hours.  The fire slowed considerably that evening as winds and temperatures decreased.

The strong to severe thunderstorms also produced very heavy rain, flooding, and even flash flooding across portions of Kalamazoo county.||Strong winds with gusts over 60 mph, along with large areas of wind damage, occurred from Muskegon to Grand Rapids and Lansing, south to Kalamazoo. In parts of Allegan county, winds were estimated between 65 to 75 mph by the National Weather Service, which conducted a storm survey of the area. These winds brought down dozens of trees and snapped eight power poles southwest of Fennville. In northwest Kalamazoo county, the winds blew the roof off a home at 15th Street and 102nd Avenue.||Large hail of three quarters of an inch in diameter or greater was reported from Muskegon to Montcalm county, including southern Newaygo and northern Kent counties. Another area or large hail stretched from Allegan county east through Ingham county and south into Kalamazoo and Jackson counties. The hail was large enough to damage some crops. The largest hail was 1.75 inches near Morley and 1.5 inches near Lakewood Club in Muskegon county.",2008,7
