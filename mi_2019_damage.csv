A large, powerful low pressure system moved up across the central Plains, with weather ranging from blizzards to tornadoes.  There were two rounds of weather that occurred across Southeast Michigan, the first round of severe weather raced northeast across the area as storms traveled at 100 mph!  The second round of severe weather, which is what brought the tornadoes to the area, was a line of thunderstorms that moved northeast just ahead of a cold front.  As this line moved across the area, there were multiple areas of circulation embedded with the line which resulted in four tornado touchdowns across Shiawassee and Genesee counties.  Three out of the four tornadoes were weak and rated an EF-0.  The tornado that hit near Vernon, MI, was rated an EF-2.  Some debris (insulation/lighter metal) from the M-71 area in Vernon was carried 7 miles by the tornado.
