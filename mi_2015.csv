Less than two days prior, Southeast Michigan saw temperatures in the 60 degree range before temperatures quickly cooled off back below freezing as the winter storm took hold. A strong area of low pressure took shape out on the central plains on Friday and strengthened as it moved east over the Mid-Mississippi River Valley. Snowfall reports of around 12 inches were reported over parts of southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. The system then took aim on Michigan, bringing with it 1+ hour snowfall rates to portions of Southeast Michigan during the afternoon and early evening hours on Saturday. Washtenaw, Livingston, Oakland, and Genesee counties were the hardest hit in terms of total snowfall amounts ranging from 10 inches to over 16 inches. Howell, MI came in with the highest snowfall amount at 16.8 inches. The NWS Detroit/Pontiac office in White Lake, MI measured 15.5 by the time the storm wrapped up which is the largest snowstorm the office has seen since it was built in 1994. ||Here are some additional higher snowfall reports: ||Clarkston (4 miles southwest) 15.5 inches.|Manchester (5 miles north) 14.2 inches. |Holly 14.0 inches.|Hartland 14 inches.|Milford 14 inches. |Lum 12.0 inches.|Peck (2 miles west) 12.0 inches.|Cement City (2 miles southeast) 10.0 inches.|Linden 10.0 inches.|Armada (2 miles south) 10.0 inches.|Durand 8.2 inches.|Yale 8.2 inches.|Garden City 8.2 inches.|Livonia 7.0 inches.",2015,1

Warm and moist air surged north into Michigan in advance of this system, overriding cool and dry air already in place. This resulted in a wintry mix in some parts of northern lower Michigan, and widespread snow elsewhere. Snowfall amounts were in the 8 to 10 inch range near and north of M-32. The highest total, just over a foot, was from Maple City in Leelanau County. Snowfall amounts fell off a bit to the south, where sleet mixed in at times, and a touch of freezing rain was also seen south of M-55. Gusty east winds resulted in considerable blowing and drifting snow. Along the Lake Huron coast from Harrisville to St Ignace, blizzard conditions were approached at times.",2015,2
