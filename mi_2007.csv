This Valentine's snowstorm marked the season's first snowfall over 2 inches for much of the affected area. Northeasterly winds frequently gusted to 30 MPH and created extensive blowing and drifting snow. In addition, temperatures were in the single digits with wind chill values around 15 below zero. The snow began Tuesday afternoon of the 13th and became heavy at times through the evening and into the early morning hours of the 14th. The winds made it extremely difficult to measure the snow, but trained spotters estimated 6 to 9 inches of snow fell on areas along and east of a line from Port Huron to Adrian. Snow drifts from 3 to 5 feet were reported across this same area. A number of county roads were impassable, prompting officials to close some roads. Several motorists had to be rescued when their vehicles became stuck in snow drifts in Lenawee County. Although lesser amounts of snow (3 to 5 inches) fell across Livingston, Genesee, and Lapeer Counties, numerous accidents and multiple cars in ditches were reported in those counties as well. Nearly all schools along and south of M-59, including Livingston County schools, closed on Valentine's Day due to the very poor road conditions. A 70 year old man from Roseville died (indirectly) of a heart attack while shoveling snow. The snow ended by sunrise on the 14th, but poor visibilities persisted for several more hours as the wind continued to blow the snow around.

This Valentine's snowstorm marked the season's first snowfall over 2 inches for much of the affected area. Northeasterly winds frequently gusted to 30 MPH and created extensive blowing and drifting snow. In addition, temperatures were in the single digits with wind chill values around 15 below zero. The snow began Tuesday afternoon of the 13th and became heavy at times through the evening and into the early morning hours of the 14th. The winds made it extremely difficult to measure the snow, but trained spotters estimated 6 to 9 inches of snow fell on areas along and east of a line from Port Huron to Adrian. Snow drifts from 3 to 5 feet were reported across this same area. A number of county roads were impassable, prompting officials to close some roads. Several motorists had to be rescued when their vehicles became stuck in snow drifts in Lenawee County. Although lesser amounts of snow (3 to 5 inches) fell across Livingston, Genesee, and Lapeer Counties, numerous accidents and multiple cars in ditches were reported in those counties as well. Nearly all schools along and south of M-59, including Livingston County schools, closed on Valentine's Day due to the very poor road conditions. A 70 year old man from Roseville died (indirectly) of a heart attack while shoveling snow. The snow ended by sunrise on the 14th, but poor visibilities persisted for several more hours as the wind continued to blow the snow around.

Over 150,000 customers were without power at one time during the ice storm. Many were without power for 2 days, and some for over 3 days.

Sustained winds of 25 to 35 MPH, with frequent gusts between 45 and 50 MPH, whipped through the area on Tuesday afternoon, April 16th. Tragically, the winds were to blame for a fatality at the Roosevelt Primary School in Ferndale. The winds snapped a 45 foot tall flagpole at the elementary school. The metal pole fell and struck a 5 year old kindergartner. The young girl died from her injuries. A trained weather spotter estimated wind gusts to 50 MPH in Troy (southern Oakland County). Numerous branches, power lines, and several trees were blown down by the winds. Up to 50,000 customers lost power. Total damages were roughly estimated at around $160K and primarily included damages to homes and electrical poles. Here are some of the highest wind gusts measured across the region: Grand Blanc (Genesee) 54 MPH, Harbor Beach (Huron) 50 MPH, Mt Clemens (Macomb) 48 MPH, Port Huron (St Clair) 47 MPH, Detroit City Airport (Wayne) 47 MPH, Pontiac (Oakland) 45 MPH.",2007,4
