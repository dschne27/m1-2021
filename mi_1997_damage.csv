Atmospheric conditions were ripe for the development of strong to severe thunderstorms containing wind gusts to 70 mph and very heavy rain. Numerous thunderstorms reached severe criteria due to damaging wind gusts. However, the most significant damage was caused by flash flooding across Allegan and Ottawa Counties, which was caused by the training effect of slow-moving thunderstorms during the day, followed by a line of severe thunderstorms which moved through during the early evening hours. Thunderstorms during the day saturated the soil across the counties, then heavy rainfall of 1 to 5 inches in a 2 hour period from a line of severe thunderstorms during the evening created extensive runoff, resulting in extensive flash flood damage.",The Wayland Police Department reported numerous trees and power lines downed across the area.

The low pressure center tracked east across Lake Superior Wednesday afternoon as the trailing strong cold front crossed Michigan's Lower Peninsula during the mid and late afternoon hours. The combination of a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass across the region and a favorable veering vertical wind profile fueled the development of widespread severe thunderstorms across the southern half of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Within the NWSO Grand Rapids county warning area, one cluster of thunderstorms developed well ahead of the cold front on Wednesday morning around 6:00 AM EDT over Lake Michigan, then moved onshore into Berrien County around 6:30 AM EDT. As this isolated cluster of severe thunderstorms crossed central and southeast Berrien County and western and southern Cass County, hail up to 2 1/4"" in diameter fell and straight-line winds were estimated as high as 70 mph. Widespread agricultural hail damage was reported in central Berrien County and a significant amount of wind damage to homes was reported in Berrien Springs and Edwardsburg. Power outages across Berrien and Cass Counties totaled 21,500 with this cluster of severe thunderstorms. During the early afternoon hours, a line of severe thunderstorms developed in Gratiot County in central Lower Michigan, then developed southwest between 3:00 and 4:30 PM EDT and affected Calhoun, Eaton, Ingham, and Clinton Counties. A small F0 tornado touched down in southwest Gratiot County, but no damage or injuries were reported. Hail up to 1 inch in diameter and wind gusts to 70 mph were associated with this line of severe thunderstorms as it crossed south central Lower Michigan. The most significant damage occurred in East Lansing in northwest Ingham County as a wet microburst occurred between 4:13 and 4:18 PM EDT. Damage was estimated to be near half a million dollars. However, no injuries were reported.","A wet microburst occurred between 4:13 and 4:18 PM EDT during a severe thunderstorm moving across East Lansing. A team of 3 scientists from Michigan State University concluded the most severe storm damage occurred between the East Lansing Library and Hagadorn Road, while the damage path extended from roughly Harrison Road and Saginaw Street in an east-southeast direction to Park Lake Road and Grand River Avenue. The MSU geology professors determined damage patterns east of Hagadorn Road suggested that another pulse of air may have come down near Hagadorn and Cahill Drive. Damage consisted of downed trees and damaged roofs. Four homes received noticeable damage, mostly by being hit by trees. Three cars were crushed by falling trees. In addition, one utility pole was snapped and power lines were downed by falling trees, cutting power to 2,000 customers of Consumers Energy. Almost all trees fell to the east. Fallen trees blocked off many East Lansing streets after the storm. No injuries were reported.",1997,7

Widespread agricultural hail damage was reported in central Berrien County and a significant amount of wind damage to homes was reported in Berrien Springs and Edwardsburg. Power outages across Berrien and Cass Counties totaled 21,500 with this cluster of severe thunderstorms. During the early afternoon hours, a line of severe thunderstorms developed in Gratiot County in central Lower Michigan, then developed southwest between 3:00 and 4:30 PM EDT and affected Calhoun, Eaton, Ingham, and Clinton Counties. A small F0 tornado touched down in southwest Gratiot County, but no damage or injuries were reported. Hail up to 1 inch in diameter and wind gusts to 70 mph were associated with this line of severe thunderstorms as it crossed south central Lower Michigan. The most significant damage occurred in East Lansing in northwest Ingham County as a wet microburst occurred between 4:13 and 4:18 PM EDT. Damage was estimated to be near half a million dollars. However, no injuries were reported.","Numerous 2 to 3 foot diameter trees were uprooted and several large trees were downed, damaging several Berrien Springs area homes, from straight-line winds in a severe thunderstorm. Wind gusts during the thunderstorm were estimated at 70 mph. A maple tree fell on a home at 10594 Old U.S. 31 at approximately 7:20 AM EDT. Another large tree came down on a house on Harrison Street, damaging the front and a ramp for the handicapped on the south side of the residence. A home on Rose Hill Street was damaged as 2 large trees destroyed a front porch, damaged the roof, and crushed 3 cars parked in the driveway. Other homes were damaged in the Bridlewood subdivision just south of Berrien Springs off Long Lake Road. A large tree fell through the roof of one home in this neighborhood, shattering a sun roof and sending a shower of glass through the cathedral ceiling onto the living-dining area of the two-level house. Numerous television antennas across the area were destroyed. One of the trees downed was a 300-year-old white oak along West Ferry Street, which was believed to be the oldest tree in the Berrien Springs area. It fell on a narrow lot, barely missing 2 homes. Trees blocked several area roads for hours and local flooding was reported. No injuries were reported.",1997,7

Numerous thunderstorms reached severe criteria due to damaging wind gusts. However, the most significant damage was caused by flash flooding across Allegan and Ottawa Counties, which was caused by the training effect of slow-moving thunderstorms during the day, followed by a line of severe thunderstorms which moved through during the early evening hours. Thunderstorms during the day saturated the soil across the counties, then heavy rainfall of 1 to 5 inches in a 2 hour period from a line of severe thunderstorms during the evening created extensive runoff, resulting in extensive flash flood damage.","Van Buren County officials reported damage from flash flooding late Friday night and early Saturday morning, June 20th and 21st, respectively. The flooding caused 8 road washouts and 35 additional roads were impassable for a time due to water flowing across them. A 15-foot section of the Kal-Haven Trail (a bike and nature trail) was washed out, leaving a gulley 8-feet deep. Baer Park in downtown South Haven was also flooded.

In addition, 2 sewage lift stations were disabled, causing sewage backups at many residences.     Ottawa County officials reported approximately 150 homes and 11 businesses damaged. Most of the damage was from flooded basements. No injuries were reported Friday evening. However, 2 boys, aged 12 and 11, received minor injuries Saturday afternoon when their raft overturned in the swollen north branch of the Black River in Holland.     On Monday, June 23rd, Ottawa County declared a local State of Emergency.

Three tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms developed along the front during mid-afternoon.  The northern-most supercell produced 9 tornado touchdowns over southern Saginaw, northern Genesee and northern Lapeer counties, including two F-3's.  A woman was killed in Thetford township when she was hit by a falling tree.  Another supercell produced F-1 tornadoes in northern Livingston and northern Oakland counties.  The tornado in northern Oakland county destroyed a mobile home park near Holly, resulting in one fatality.  The southern-most supercell produced an F-2 tornado that passed over densly populated northern Wayne county, including the northern part of the city of Detroit.  The result was nearly 100 million dollars in damage in northern Wayne county alone, as the tornado cut a swath of heavy damage from northwest Detroit through Highland Park and Hamtramack.  Miraculously, no one was killed in that area, although nearly 100 injuries were reported.  Meanwhile, just to the north, an F-0 tornado and strong straight-line winds did about 30 million dollars in Macomb county.  Tragically, the greatest loss of life on the 2d occurred in Grosse Pointe Farms, where straight-line winds of nearly 100-mph blew a gazeebo full of people into Lake Saint Clair.  Five deaths and 8 injuries resulted.       The severe storms also resulted in extensive flash flooding and flooding around the Detroit metro area.  Several highways were flooded in northern Wayne and southern Macomb counties late on the 2d.

The cold front moved onshore in western Lower Michigan around 5 PM EDT Sunday, April 6th. Winds increased to sustained speeds of 35 to 45 mph out of the west shortly after frontal passage. Frequent wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph were common through midnight, Sunday night. Winds continued to gust to gale force through 5 PM EDT Monday, April 7th. The U.S. Coast Guard reported wave heights of 10 to 15 feet near the Lake Michigan shoreline.     Widespread wind damage and lake shore beach erosion was reported across the area. Area insurance companies estimated claims totaled nearly $5.0 million from the wind damage. However, no serious injuries were reported from the storm.      The winds downed trees and power lines and resulted in roof damage to area homes and businesses. Between 180,000 and 200,000 Consumers Energy customers lost power across the state Sunday evening. Nearly 70,000 customers were still without power Monday morning at 5 AM EDT.     The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported severe beach erosion resulted in as much as 20 feet of beach loss in a few areas. Bluffs in Saugatuck township appeared to be hit hardest. The beach erosion was due in part to unusually high lake water levels, nearly 38 inches above average.     Numerous reports of downed trees and power lines were received. Roads were blocked in some areas due to downed wires, trees, and traffic lights. Downed wires set sporadic fires in a few instances.

The driver, a 17 year-old male was in serious condition upon arriving at a local hospital. Two cars collided on Michigan Highway 66 in Calhoun County around 10:30 am, resulting in a fatality. No information about the victim was available. Another fatal accident claimed the life of a Spring Arbor man who was killed instantly when his automobile was struck by oncoming traffic, after he lost control when trying to pass a county snow plow on southbound U.S. Highway 127 around 3 pm in Jackson County.

Several thousands of trees were downed by the winds, which were estimated to be in excess of 100 miles an hour.  600 buildings sustained wind and hail  damage along with numerous vehicles.The most severe property damage locations included Maplewood, Thompson, 7 miles northeast of Manistique and 4 miles west of Gulliver.  In Maplewood, a mobile home had its roof blown off and foundation shifted. Two sections of the Hiawatha National Forest suffered extensive tree damage. Those areas were along Delta County Road 509 between Rapid River and Haymeadow Falls (8 N of Rapid River) and east of Indian Lake north of Manistique in Schoolcraft County where 18 areas of  damage were located. The U. S. Forest Service estimated 9000 acres of forest very seriously damaged in Delta County  with 30 million board feet of timber down and a net loss of $2.25 million.   The Michigan Department of Natural Resources suffered 500 acres of tree loss in Schoolcraft County between Cooks and Thompson with a net loss of $500 thousand. Corporate owned forest land also suffered over 200 acres of tree loss valued at $113 thousand between Cooks and Wiggins Point on the Garden Peninsula and near Gulliver.  In Thompson,  several trees, mostly 8-16 inch diameter pines, were snapped off between 6 and 12 feet above the ground. Three vehicles and several hundred structures sustained wind and/or hail damage.  Northeast of Manistique, a roof was blown off a large metal garage and metal barn and a 30 inch diameter pine tree fell puncturing a roof on a house.

Later that afternoon, with very humid and unstable air in place across far southern Lower Michigan, another frontal wave caused severe thunderstorm development along the southern 2 tier of counties across southern Michigan. The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches in the counties bordering northern Indiana and northern Ohio, along with isolated reports of wind damage from 60 mph thunderstorm wind gusts. One thunderstorm produced golfball-sized hail in Edwardsburg in Cass County on Saturday afternoon.
