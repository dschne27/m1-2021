This resulted in up to 10 inches of snow in an area extending from the intersection of M59 and US23 northeastward through the thumb region of Michigan. Unseasonably warm air ahead of this system led to a period of moderate rain Saturday morning and into the early afternoon. By mid afternoon the rain had changed over to a very wet snow and for the most part continued to melt as it fell while temperatures remained above freezing. At sunset, temperatures fell to the freezing mark and snow began accumulating around 1800 EST on the 4th and reached 6 inches by midnight. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches an hour occurred across portions of the thumb overnight. The large wet snowflakes easily stuck to rain soaked trees. The weighted trees were further stressed by northwest winds gusting to 35 mph and caused many branches to break. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power with 15 electrical wires down in Lapeer County alone. Accumulating snow ended at 1100 EST on the 5th.

After a lull, very heavy precipitation arrived in the afternoon.  This fell as rain and freezing rain south of a line from Houghton Lake to Harrisville, and snow to the north.  Thunder was common in this portion of the event, with 1 to 2 inch per hour snow accumulations (locally higher), and a quarter to a half inch of ice accumulation in places like Gladwin and Tawas City.  Another lull arrived in the evening, before wraparound snow and lake effect snow kicked in during the night and continued into the next day.  Parts of Chippewa County saw the snow continue into the 18th.  Storm total accumulations were from 6 to 15 inches, generally south of M-28, and north of Houghton Lake and Harrisville.  The highest accumulations, greater than a foot, were in a narrow band from Frankfort to Gaylord to Rogers City.  Strong winds, especially during the afternoon of the 16th through the 17th, produced considerable blowing snow and drifts as high as 4 feet.  Many areas schools let out early on the 16th (a Thursday), in anticipation of the heavier round of snow expected that afternoon.  That would prove wise, as there were a number of vehicle accidents in the near-zero visibility that the thundersnow produced.  A number of schools remained closed into the 17th.

Vegetation was vulnerable to wildfires given the dry weather and that most trees had not greened up yet.  The Hughes Lake Fire began early in the afternoon of April 30th, ignited by an individual burning brush in a fire pit.  The fire spread northwest from Hughes Lake thanks to southeast winds of 10 to 20 mph.  The rate of spread reached as high as 2 miles per hour late in the afternoon of the 30th, with flame heights reaching 300 feet tall.  Containment activities brought the fire under control by late afternoon of May 1st, though mop-up would continue for several days after.  Crews were flown in from as far away as New Mexico and Montana to fight the fire.  At the heights of the fire, almost 300 personnel were involved in fighting the fire.  Approximately 5950 acres of timber and brushland burned, south of M-72, east of M-18, and west of M-33.  Stands of jack pine, which burn very readily, contributed to the intensity of the fire.  Sixteen structures were destroyed, though only a couple were residential, and those were likely seasonal residences.  Seven vehicles were destroyed.  A number of evacuations were ordered, some as far west as M-18 in southeast Crawford County, though most residents returned to their homes within a few days.  An American Red Cross shelter in Luzerne hosted seven individuals.  Total damage to property was conservatively estimated at $600,000.

Near record to record setting high temperatures, in the low to mid 90's, sent some people to the hospital. The official high temperatures for the day ranged from 88 to 93 degrees. Of the 52 cooperative observer reports received for that day, including at least one report from each of the 17 counties in southeast lower Michigan, 50 of them reported a high above 90. They ranged from 89 (along the lakeshore) to 98 (at Midland), and averaged out at 94 degrees. Most of the month of May, leading up to this weekend, was well below normal. Combining this factor with temperatures at 20 to 30 degrees above the seasonal norms created very uncomfortable conditions. Conditions were further exacerbated by the combination of high humidity, light winds, and mostly clear skies. Nearly all of southeast lower Michigan reached 90 degrees by Noon EST...the only exceptions included those locations immediately adjacent to the lakes. Heat indices were in the mid 90's throughout most of the day. At least 27 people passed out in Roseville after the late morning Memorial Day Parade. Most were treated on the scene for dehydration, however, eight were taken to the hospital and treated for heat related illnesses. They included High School band members marching in the parade, a cheerleader, and one military veteran.  According to local newspapers, at least 20 other people, from across the entire region, were admitted to area hospitals for heat illnesses. This number was likely much larger.

Intense thunderstorms fired along and ahead of a cold front working down from the northern Great Lakes and eventually developed into a large MCS by mid evening. The Tri Cities and thumb regions were especially hard hit during this event. Several microbursts actually produced 100 MPH wind gusts across northeast Huron county, causing quite a bit of damage. The outflow created from the storms across the north actually held together long enough to spread south. There were several reports of trees blown down in areas south of M-59, although the damage was minimal when compared to the destruction across the northern parts of the area. Very few reports of hail were received, however, golf ball size hail was reported in Saginaw County. This event caused one death and one injury in Wayne County. A couple was struck by lightning after seeking refuge under a tree.","Local newspaper articles reported that the storms left behind a trail of destruction through Harbor Beach, with numerous trees, some very large, ripped from their roots and power lines down through the entire area. The storms left the entire city without power. Many vehicles and structures, including homes,  were damaged by fallen debris. Several boats were tossed about and washed ashore on Sand Point. An NWS survey confirmed that this area was struck by a microburst with winds up to 100 MPH. Remarkably, No injuries or deaths were reported.

As the storms interacted with the surface warm front, the storms began to immediately rotate. Several circulations were noted at any given time. One tornado, rated at F0 intensity, touched down near Addison in Lenawee County. The severe thunderstorms resulted in a mix of high wind and large hail, with several reports of hail the size of golf balls. In addition, the warm front remained nearly stationary through much of the event, which resulted in echo training and flash flooding across Lenawee and Monroe counties.","A lightning strike tore a large hole in the roof of an upscale home, causing extensive damage.

A 5 day stretch of maximum temperatures at or above 90 degrees began on Saturday, July 29th. A blanket of especially high heat and oppressive humidity settled over the area on Monday, July 31st, and remained relentless through Wednesday, August 2nd. Temperatures, on the 31st, soared above 90 by noon with heat indices over 100 degrees. Heat indices averaged between 105 and 110 degrees through the entire afternoon. Detroit topped out at 96 and set a new high temperature record for July 31st, breaking the previous record of 95 set in 1955. Little relief was felt Monday evening with temperatures not dropping below 90 until 1900 EST. Most significantly, Detroit Metro tied the all time record for the warmest minimum temperature, for any date, when it failed to record a temperature below 80 degrees on July 31st.  This had happened only 3 other times in the previous 136 years of record keeping, and this was the first time in 64 years that it had happened again. The major power companies in the area reported an all-time record customer demand for power from 1500 to 1600 EDT on the 31st. Remarkably, very few heat related illnesses occurred during the event. Newspaper articles revealed an extremely high level of awareness and preparedness from the communities across southeast lower Michigan. A large number of cooling centers were made available to those in need as folks reportedly heeded the warnings and took extra precaution. Although area hospitals reported some increase due to heat related illnesses, most were mild and due to heat exhaustion and dehydration.

Little relief was felt during the evening with temperatures not dropping below 90 until 1900 EST. The major power companies in the area reported an all-time record customer demand for power from 1500 to 1600 EDT on the 1st, breaking the record that was set just the day before. Remarkably, very few heat related illnesses occurred during the event. Newspaper articles revealed an extremely high level of awareness and preparedness from the communities across southeast lower Michigan. A large number of cooling centers were made available to those in need as folks reportedly heeded the warnings and took extra precaution. Although area hospitals reported some increase due to heat related illnesses, most were mild and due to heat exhaustion and dehydration. Six cases of heatstroke were confirmed in Washtenaw, Wayne, and Macomb Counties. No heat related deaths were reported.",,2006,8

A 5 day stretch of maximum temperatures at or above 90 degrees began on Saturday, July 29th. A blanket of especially high heat and oppressive humidity settled over the area on Monday, July 31st, and remained relentless through Wednesday, August 2nd. Temperatures soared above 90 by noon with heat indices over 100 degrees. Heat indices averaged between 105 and 110 degrees through the entire afternoon. Most significantly, Detroit Metro tied the all time record for the warmest minimum temperature, for any date, when it failed to record a temperature below 80 degrees on July 31st.  This had happened only 3 other times in the previous 136 years of record keeping, and this was the first time in 64 years that it had happened again. Detroit topped out at 97 and set a new high temperature record for August 1st,  tying the old record set in 1988. Little relief was felt during the evening with temperatures not dropping below 90 until 1900 EST. The major power companies in the area reported an all-time record customer demand for power from 1500 to 1600 EDT on the 1st, breaking the record that was set just the day before. Remarkably, very few heat related illnesses occurred during the event. Newspaper articles revealed an extremely high level of awareness and preparedness from the communities across southeast lower Michigan. A large number of cooling centers were made available to those in need as folks reportedly heeded the warnings and took extra precaution. Although area hospitals reported some increase due to heat related illnesses, most were mild and due to heat exhaustion and dehydration. Six cases of heatstroke were confirmed in Washtenaw, Wayne, and Macomb Counties. No heat related deaths were reported.",,2006,8

Detroit topped out at 97 and set a new high temperature record for August 1st,  tying the old record set in 1988. Little relief was felt during the evening with temperatures not dropping below 90 until 1900 EST. The major power companies in the area reported an all-time record customer demand for power from 1500 to 1600 EDT on the 1st, breaking the record that was set just the day before.

Most significantly, Detroit Metro tied the all time record for the warmest minimum temperature, for any date, when it failed to record a temperature below 80 degrees on July 31st.  This had happened only 3 other times in the previous 136 years of record keeping, and this was the first time in 64 years that it had happened again. Detroit topped out at 97 and set a new high temperature record for August 1st,  tying the old record set in 1988. Little relief was felt during the evening with temperatures not dropping below 90 until 1900 EST. The major power companies in the area reported an all-time record customer demand for power from 1500 to 1600 EDT on the 1st, breaking the record that was set just the day before. Remarkably, very few heat related illnesses occurred during the event. Newspaper articles revealed an extremely high level of awareness and preparedness from the communities across southeast lower Michigan. A large number of cooling centers were made available to those in need as folks reportedly heeded the warnings and took extra precaution. Although area hospitals reported some increase due to heat related illnesses, most were mild and due to heat exhaustion and dehydration. Six cases of heatstroke were confirmed in Washtenaw, Wayne, and Macomb Counties. No heat related deaths were reported.",,2006,8
