High winds along the associated cold front knocked down trees leading to widespread power outages. Winds were sustained out of the southwest at 30 to 40 mph with gusts as high as 60 mph from mid to late morning, becoming more westerly during the early afternoon. The highest winds occurred between 1000 EST and 1400 EST, taking their toll on trees still laden with the season's dying leaves. Street signs were toppled, traffic lights were sent spinning, and power lines were split. Many streets and roads had to be temporarily closed until trees blocking the way could be cleared. Utility companies reported approximately 200,000 customers lost power in Southeast Lower Michigan...with the majority of the outages occurring across Oakland and Wayne counties. Particularly hard hit were densely populated communities with mature trees like Detroit, Livonia, Westland, and Taylor. Property damage (mostly minor) was estimated at 4.2 million dollars. There were no reported deaths or injuries with this event. At least one business caught fire from downed power lines. Here are some official wind gusts recorded across the region.
