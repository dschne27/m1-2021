The fire quickly expanded as it raced to the northwest, crossing I-75 by late afternoon between the Four Mile Road and I-75 Business Loop exits.  Eventually, 1300 acres were burned, and the fire threatened the Ramada Inn and Admiral gas station on the far south end of Grayling.  However, the only structures lost were about half a dozen cabins near the Simpson Lakes, about two miles south of downtown Grayling.  Damage at the Grayling Game Club was near $287,000.  In addition, a State of Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) transport truck, used to bring bulldozers to the fire line, was claimed by the fire.  Total cost of the fire to the DNR was $619,000.  This included both the cost of suppressing the fire, and damage done to timber and the transport.  (Note that fire suppression costs are not considered damages done by the fire.)  Power was lost in Grayling, fifty homes were evacuated, and I-75 was closed for several hours.  The fire slowed considerably that evening as winds and temperatures decreased.
