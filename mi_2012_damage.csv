From near Grand Rapids off to the south, only about 4 to 6 inches of snow fell, much of it melting and compacting late Friday morning and afternoon as temperatures climbed through the 30s.",Twelve inches of snow was reported in Harrison in Clare county.  Eleven inches of snow was reported in Leota.,2012,2

Precipitation surged north into Northern Michigan early in the day on the 20th, falling primarily as snow over Eastern Upper and the high terrain of Northern Lower, and as a rain/snow mix near the coasts.  The snow was heavy where it was all snow, with 6 to 9 inches falling during the day in some areas.  As night arrived, cooler air started to enter the region, and precipitation changed to all snow (except near Saginaw Bay).  Another, more widespread round of heavy snow resulted.  Total snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches were common near the Northern Lower Michigan coastline, ramping up to 10 to 20 inches in Eastern Upper and higher terrain of Northern Lower.  The highest accumulations, 18 to 20 inches, fell on Gaylord in Northern Lower Michigan, and Kinross in Eastern Upper.  The snow was wet and sticky early on, especially in Northern Lower, and the resulting weight of the snow produced considerable damage to trees.  Hundreds of downed trees and limbs resulted in widespread power outages in parts of Northern Lower, some of which weren't restored until around Christmas Day.  Travel was brought to a near-standstill in some areas for a day or two, with gusty winds throughout the event producing problems with blowing and drifting snow.  All told, this was very much a high-impact winter storm in Northern Michigan.",,2012,2
