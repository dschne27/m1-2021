The snowfall was heavy at times during the afternoon and evening hours north of a line from roughly Ann Arbor to Port Huron, with 1 inch per hour rates common.  The snowfall tapered off for a time overnight as the main precip shield was shunted to the west, but lingering moisture and forcing moved across Southeast Michigan once more during the morning hours of the 25th, adding a few more inches to storm totals. ||All told, the heaviest amounts from 12 to 14 inches occurred in a stripe across Lapeer County, southern portions of Shiawassee and Genesee Counties, and northern portions of Oakland and Livingston Counties.  At least 8 was common north and west of the glacial ridge.  Lesser amounts of 2 to 4 inches occurred over the city of Detroit, with a tight gradient in snowfall in between.
