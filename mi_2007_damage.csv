Damage was observed at the Three Rivers Muncipal Airport and at an adjacent residence to the airport. A hangar door was blown open at the airport, with 2 large tree trunks falling onto parked vehicles at a private residence. One of the vehicles had pulled into the driveway due to poor visbility, and before the driver could exit, the tree trunk fell onto the roof of the car, causing minor head injury to the driver. The Three Rivers AWOS (KHAI) recorded a 68 mph wind gust at 548 pm EDT. As the survey progressed along M-60 to some of the back roads, more extensive damage began to be encountered. A barn was found destroyed by a combination of the strong winds and a small shed being picked up and thrown into the barn. An adjacent barn also suffered moderate damage from the wind. Numerous trees limbs were snapped in the yard, as well as the chimney of the 2 story residence being blown over to roof level. Just to the north of this residence a large grove of various hardwood trees suffered extensive damage with many trees being uprooted or snapped. The sandy soil in the area reduced the resistance of the roots somewhat.  A residence as well as a barn suffered only minor damage despite the estimated 90 to 95 mph winds. KIWX 88D Base velocity data showed a couplet with 82 kt (94 mph) outbound winds in this general area. Damage continued northeast towards Mendon where trees continued to be damaged as well as 2 barns. |With the strength of the winds, it is possible that a few gust front tornadoes (gustnadoes) may have developed and helped locally focus some of the damage, but by far the strength of the straight line winds was more significant then the potential winds of any gustnadoes.",2007,5

The snow began Tuesday afternoon of the 13th and became heavy at times through the evening and into the early morning hours of the 14th. The winds made it extremely difficult to measure the snow, but trained spotters estimated 6 to 9 inches of snow fell on areas along and east of a line from Port Huron to Adrian. Snow drifts from 3 to 5 feet were reported across this same area. A number of county roads were impassable, prompting officials to close some roads. Several motorists had to be rescued when their vehicles became stuck in snow drifts in Lenawee County. Although lesser amounts of snow (3 to 5 inches) fell across Livingston, Genesee, and Lapeer Counties, numerous accidents and multiple cars in ditches were reported in those counties as well. Nearly all schools along and south of M-59, including Livingston County schools, closed on Valentine's Day due to the very poor road conditions. A 70 year old man from Roseville died (indirectly) of a heart attack while shoveling snow. The snow ended by sunrise on the 14th, but poor visibilities persisted for several more hours as the wind continued to blow the snow around.

It was estimated that 100 homes suffered some type of water damage, with at least 30 homes flooded by at least 2 feet of water.

Sustained winds of 25 to 35 MPH, with frequent gusts between 45 and 50 MPH, whipped through the area on Tuesday afternoon, April 16th. Tragically, the winds were to blame for a fatality at the Roosevelt Primary School in Ferndale. The winds snapped a 45 foot tall flagpole at the elementary school. The metal pole fell and struck a 5 year old kindergartner. The young girl died from her injuries. A trained weather spotter estimated wind gusts to 50 MPH in Troy (southern Oakland County). Numerous branches, power lines, and several trees were blown down by the winds. Up to 50,000 customers lost power. Total damages were roughly estimated at around $160K and primarily included damages to homes and electrical poles.

The day started out cool and rainy, but a dry slot aloft allowed sunshine to break out in the afternoon.  Temperatures rose into the lower to middle 70s in parts of the area.  The warm and humid air was unstable enough to fuel multiple rounds of thunderstorms in the late afternoon and evening hours.  There was a tremendous amount of shear in the atmosphere, and many storms quickly became supercells with rotating updrafts.  This was an environment conducive to tornadoes, as several lines of discrete supercells crossed Northern Lower Michigan.||Northern Lower Michigan had a record six tornadoes on the day.  The previous high was five, set on June 17 1992.  Unfortunately, the Kalkaska tornado produced a fatality.  That was the first tornado fatality in Northern Lower Michigan since March 30 1976, when a single death occurred in Ogemaw County.","The Kalkaska tornado was the first killer tornado in Northern Lower Michigan in over 30 years.  It touched down just south of Crofton, and tracked north-northeast, lifting just after crossing the Kalkaska County Airport.  A home was damaged in a subdivision just south of Crofton.  The most substantial damage, as well as the fatality, occurred near the intersection of US-131 and Crofton Road.  A large metal warehouse was damaged, a single wide mobile home was destroyed, and several stick-built homes received moderate to severe damage.  The fatality and injury occurred inside the mobile home.  A 29 year old man was pulled from the mobile home, but passed away at a nearby hospital.  Numerous large trees were also uprooted.  The damage became more sporadic to the northeast, until another pocket of concentrated damage at the Kalkaska County Airport.  Several hangars and small planes were damaged, as were several homes in the area.  Sheet metal from one of the hangars was deposited near the Kalkaska Middle School.  Winds were estimated at 120 mph, making it an EF2.",2007,0
