Over 160 flights were cancelled, and all traffic at the airport was halted for a half hour period during the afternoon.During the closest approach of the low pressure system, east winds increased dramatically.  A brief surge of wind in mid afternoon brought gusts to around 40 mph.  A few power lines were downed here and there, but the worst of the wind was three miles north of Utica, where a tree fell on a home.",,2000,4

Shortly after midnight, a line of thunderstorms moved from Gogebic County, east, through southern Iron and central Dickinson Counties, producing large hail which damaged homes and vehicles in Iron River and Randville.

A low topped supercell formed along the warm front and was responsible for spawning an F1 tornado.

A complex of thunderstorms moved east across northern Michigan in the early morning hours.  Outflow from this thunderstorm complex moved south into southeast Michigan as a miniature cold front, and thunderstorms redeveloped along the leading edge of this outflow in the afternoon.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms also developed in northeast Indiana, along the edge of a deck of low clouds.  These separate areas of thunderstorms would merge over Metro Detroit in the late afternoon and early evening, producing tremendous amounts of rain.  Many places had seen heavy rain the day before, and thus the area was quite vulnerable to flooding.At Detroit Metro Airport, 3.71 inches of rain fell on the 11th.  This was the wettest September day ever in Detroit, and the 5th wettest day of all time.  This was on top of the 1.65 inches that fell the day before.  National Weather Service radar estimated around 5 inches of rain fell on the 11th in a swath from Brownstown Township to Allen Park in Wayne County.  In Washtenaw County, 2.26 inches of rain fell in Ann Arbor, after 1.32 inches the previous day.The storms had a broad impact.  Over 30,000 households were affected by power outages.  About one hundred flights out of Detroit Metro Airport were cancelled, and numerous people were stranded at the airport overnight due to the multitude of flooded roads in the area.  A collision on Interstate 94 in Harrison Township (Macomb County) during a downpour closed the highway for two hours.  Sewage overflows were common in Wayne County, as the water treatment system was quickly overwhelmed; the failure of some pumping operations due to power outages contributed to the sewer backup.  Several lawsuits were filed in connection with damage caused by raw sewage.","Lightning struck the ground at an athletic field as kids were rushing to leave soccer practice.

Scattered thunderstorms developed in the afternoon, with several storms moving repeatedly over central and eastern Oakland County.  The National Weather Service Office in White Lake measured 2.53 inches of rain; Pontiac received closer to 3 inches.Most of the area could handle the rain, as it had been fairly dry in the area since late August.  However, the heaviest rain fell at exactly the wrong time, in exactly the wrong place.  At the Pontiac Silverdome, the Detroit Lions were hosting their home opener for the new NFL season, with a game time of 4 pm against the Washington Redskins.  The deluge hit in the one to two hours before kickoff, just as over 80,000 attendees were making their way to the east side of Pontiac for the game.The Silverdome rests in the valley of the Clinton River, and the area is known to be flood-prone.  The city wastewater treatment plant sits almost next door to the Silverdome.   A pump failure at the plant during the heavy rain contributed to standing water surrounding much of the Silverdome.  Hundreds of fans had to abandon their vehicles and wade their way into the stadium.  The tunnel entrance to the playing field also flooded.  The large amount of flood damage in vehicles in and around the Silverdome prompted a Presidential Disaster Declaration.Problems were more isolated in the rest of Oakland County.  A small creek in Commerce Township, in a newly developed area, rose out of its banks.  Roads, back yards, and a golf course were flooded.  A drainage problem led to water two feet deep over some streets in a Lake Orion subdivision.  Other communities impacted included Waterford, Farmington Hills, West Bloomfield, and Auburn Hills.  The heavy rain would also set the stage for serious flooding the next day.",,2000,9

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.  Many schools were closed the next day due to damage or power outages; some schools and businesses did not reopen for several days.",,2000,5

Meanwhile, thunderstorms also developed in northeast Indiana, along the edge of a deck of low clouds.  These separate areas of thunderstorms would merge over Metro Detroit in the late afternoon and early evening, producing tremendous amounts of rain.  Many places had seen heavy rain the day before, and thus the area was quite vulnerable to flooding.At Detroit Metro Airport, 3.71 inches of rain fell on the 11th.

About one hundred flights out of Detroit Metro Airport were cancelled, and numerous people were stranded at the airport overnight due to the multitude of flooded roads in the area.  A collision on Interstate 94 in Harrison Township (Macomb County) during a downpour closed the highway for two hours.  Sewage overflows were common in Wayne County, as the water treatment system was quickly overwhelmed; the failure of some pumping operations due to power outages contributed to the sewer backup.  Several lawsuits were filed in connection with damage caused by raw sewage.","Central and eastern Oakland County received an inch or so of rain on the 11th.

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.

Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.

A complex of thunderstorms moved east across northern Michigan in the early morning hours.  Outflow from this thunderstorm complex moved south into southeast Michigan as a miniature cold front, and thunderstorms redeveloped along the leading edge of this outflow in the afternoon.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms also developed in northeast Indiana, along the edge of a deck of low clouds.  These separate areas of thunderstorms would merge over Metro Detroit in the late afternoon and early evening, producing tremendous amounts of rain.  Many places had seen heavy rain the day before, and thus the area was quite vulnerable to flooding.At Detroit Metro Airport, 3.71 inches of rain fell on the 11th.  This was the wettest September day ever in Detroit, and the 5th wettest day of all time.  This was on top of the 1.65 inches that fell the day before.  National Weather Service radar estimated around 5 inches of rain fell on the 11th in a swath from Brownstown Township to Allen Park in Wayne County.  In Washtenaw County, 2.26 inches of rain fell in Ann Arbor, after 1.32 inches the previous day.The storms had a broad impact.  Over 30,000 households were affected by power outages.  About one hundred flights out of Detroit Metro Airport were cancelled, and numerous people were stranded at the airport overnight due to the multitude of flooded roads in the area.  A collision on Interstate 94 in Harrison Township (Macomb County) during a downpour closed the highway for two hours.  Sewage overflows were common in Wayne County, as the water treatment system was quickly overwhelmed; the failure of some pumping operations due to power outages contributed to the sewer backup.  Several lawsuits were filed in connection with damage caused by raw sewage.","Widespread, severe urban flooding resulted in a Presidential Disaster Declaration for Wayne County.  The communities most severely affected included Allen Park, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Ecorse, Lincoln Park, Melvindale, Riverview, Southgate, Taylor, Van Buren Township, Wyandotte, and Wayne.  Over 15,000 residences and other structures in Wayne County suffered at least some flood damage.  Individual communities tallies included: 2700 homes in Allen Park, at least 500 in Lincoln Park, 2200 in Southgate,  and 8000 in Wyandotte.  In Allen Park, an estimated 40% of all streets flooded at some point during the event.  Underpasses flooded in Dearborn and Dearborn, and street flooding was widespread, especially near Ecorse Creek.  The Southfield Freeway were covered with two to three feet of water.  In Detroit, the failure of a pumping system caused the Lodge Freeway to flood with two to three feet of water.  The basement of city hall was damaged by flood waters in Lincoln Park, and street flooding was also widespread.  In Riverview, street flooding was again widespread, with water approaching the doorsteps of some homes.  A home in Riverview had its basement collapse.  The Romulus area saws numerous roads flood, especially around Detroit Metropolitan Airport; numerous motorists had to be rescued from their stalled and stranded vehicles between 6 and 8 pm.  Three feet of water covered Fort Street in Wyandotte.  The Governor of Michigan estimated $19 million in personal property damage in Wayne County, but said that estimate was ""conservative"".",2000,9

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.  Many schools were closed the next day due to damage or power outages; some schools and businesses did not reopen for several days.",,2000,5

Thunderstorms developed explosively early in the afternoon, and many became severe.Large hail was the predominant severe weather type on this day.  The strongest storm of the day was a supercell that moved south along the Lake Huron lake breeze boundary.  This storm developed near Port Sanilac, and moved through Port Huron before exiting the area near Algonac.  Golfball sized hail was reported near Lexington and Port Huron with this storm.  Hailstones as large as baseballs crashed down on Algonac, damaging cars and roofs, ripping gutters off of homes, denting air conditioning units, and breaking windows.  The force of impact when these hailstones landed in Algonac canals propelled water 5 feet into the air.  Several other storms produced large hail, though none as large as in Algonac.  Golfball sized hail also fell in metro Flint, as well as near Hartland.  Dime, nickel, and quarter sized hail was quite common.Wind damage was not as widespread, though a few very strong gusts occurred.

It was an Alberta clipper that moved into lower Michigan during the evening hours of the 19th. Most of the snow fell between 7 p.m. EST on the 19th until 2 a.m. EST on the 20th. During this time period, one to three inches of snow fell between I-94 and I-96. As winds became westerly and cold air begin to filter in, lake effect snow developed, and many locations received an additional 4 to 8 inches of snow by 9 a.m. on the 20th. Most of this snow fell along a line from (roughly) Muskegon to Paw Paw, Kalamazoo and Battle Creek. A secondary arctic cold front moved through during the afternoon and evening hours of the 20th, causing winds to become more westerly. 6 to 12 inches of snow fell across parts of Mason and Oceana counties, mainly during the afternoon hours of the 20th. As colder air continued to move in, a dominant lake effect snow band set up from Muskegon to Grand Rapids during the evening hours of the 20th, lasting 6 to 8 hours.

Some snowfall totals in specific locations: Albion (Calhoun county): 18 inches; NWS Grand Rapids (Kent county): 15.1 inches; Lansing (Ingham county): 14.5 inches; Kalamazoo (Kalamazoo county) 13.7 inches; Muskegon (Muskegon county): 10.8 inches; Battle Creek (Calhoun county): 13 inches; Paw Paw (Van Buren county): 10 inches; Hastings (Barry county): 12 inches; Holland (Ottawa county): 9.5 inches.  The combination of the heavy snow and winds that gusted to 40 m.p.h. created blizzard conditions at times, causing virtually every school and many businesses to close for a day. In fact many area schools, particularly in outlying and rural areas, were closed for several days and even a week in some instances. Numerous accidents were reported in blowing and drifting snow. Many counties reported upwards of 100 accidents occurring between 7 a.m. on the 11th and 7 a.m. on the 12th.",,2000,2

As the low moved to the east, arctic air returned to the Great Lakes, changing precipitation back to snow.  A strong upper level disturbance enhanced snowfall during the early morning hours of the 17th.  Snowfall amounts were as high as 7 inches in Wheeler, Akron, Fairgrove Township (Tuscola County), Corunna, Bay City, Saginaw, and Flint.  In the Tri-Cities area, high winds combined with the snow to drift many roads shut, and to snap off snow-covered tree limbs.  About 7000 homes lost power.  In Flint, the weight of the accumulated snow collapsed the roof of a banquet room at a Ramada Inn.  A home patio roof also gave way in Flint.  Much of the rest of southeast Michigan saw 2 to 4 inches of snow.  A furniture/appliance/electronics store in Tecumseh saw its roof collapse under the snow.  The storm contributed to dozens of accidents on Washtenaw County roads.This storm would be the last big one of the month, though another few inches would fall here and there.  A low pressure system would drop 2 to 4 inches of snow on the night of the 18th into the morning of the 19th.  A lake effect snow event would produce isolated reports of heavy snow in the Thumb just before the New Year.  Detroit would end the month with 25.1 inches of snow, making it the 3rd snowiest December on record, dating back to 1870.  But both Flint and Saginaw had that beat.  With 35.3 and 40.3 inches of snow respectively, both cities set all time snowfall records for ANY month.The snow would cause problems across southeast Michigan for weeks to come.  The sheer volume of it was difficult to handle, and the process of moving it out of the way became difficult (and expensive), as there was almost no place to put it.  Many communities used the majority of their snow removal budget, and their road salt supply, during December.  There were fears that both would run out if the winter did not calm down.  In Lenawee County, snow removal expenditures were greater in December 2000 than for all of the previous winter.  Ice dams and water seepage confounded thousands of businesses and homeowners well into January.  Several house fires erupted when meltwater seeped into electric meter boxes.",,2000,2

Thunderstorms developed explosively early in the afternoon, and many became severe.Large hail was the predominant severe weather type on this day.  The strongest storm of the day was a supercell that moved south along the Lake Huron lake breeze boundary.  This storm developed near Port Sanilac, and moved through Port Huron before exiting the area near Algonac.  Golfball sized hail was reported near Lexington and Port Huron with this storm.  Hailstones as large as baseballs crashed down on Algonac, damaging cars and roofs, ripping gutters off of homes, denting air conditioning units, and breaking windows.  The force of impact when these hailstones landed in Algonac canals propelled water 5 feet into the air.  Several other storms produced large hail, though none as large as in Algonac.  Golfball sized hail also fell in metro Flint, as well as near Hartland.

However, thanks to a strong upper level disturbance, temperatures aloft cooled off much more quickly.  This cold air aloft, combined with ample heating from sunshine on the 14th, resulted in an unstable atmosphere.  Thunderstorms developed explosively early in the afternoon, and many became severe.Large hail was the predominant severe weather type on this day.  The strongest storm of the day was a supercell that moved south along the Lake Huron lake breeze boundary.  This storm developed near Port Sanilac, and moved through Port Huron before exiting the area near Algonac.  Golfball sized hail was reported near Lexington and Port Huron with this storm.  Hailstones as large as baseballs crashed down on Algonac, damaging cars and roofs, ripping gutters off of homes, denting air conditioning units, and breaking windows.  The force of impact when these hailstones landed in Algonac canals propelled water 5 feet into the air.  Several other storms produced large hail, though none as large as in Algonac.  Golfball sized hail also fell in metro Flint, as well as near Hartland.  Dime, nickel, and quarter sized hail was quite common.Wind damage was not as widespread, though a few very strong gusts occurred.  Numerous trees were downed between Gratiot and Court Streets in Saginaw, damaging vehicles, fences, and outbuildings.

The strongest storm of the day was a supercell that moved south along the Lake Huron lake breeze boundary.  This storm developed near Port Sanilac, and moved through Port Huron before exiting the area near Algonac.  Golfball sized hail was reported near Lexington and Port Huron with this storm.  Hailstones as large as baseballs crashed down on Algonac, damaging cars and roofs, ripping gutters off of homes, denting air conditioning units, and breaking windows.  The force of impact when these hailstones landed in Algonac canals propelled water 5 feet into the air.  Several other storms produced large hail, though none as large as in Algonac.  Golfball sized hail also fell in metro Flint, as well as near Hartland.  Dime, nickel, and quarter sized hail was quite common.Wind damage was not as widespread, though a few very strong gusts occurred.  Numerous trees were downed between Gratiot and Court Streets in Saginaw, damaging vehicles, fences, and outbuildings.
