The severe weather occurred along and south of the Interstate 94 corridor.  A storm passing just south of downtown Battle Creek produced a tornado just after 11 PM EST. Parts of Calhoun and Kalamazoo counties also received heavy rain that produced flash flooding.,The tornado touched down near the intersection of Capitol Avenue and East Stafford Avenue just east of Goguac Lake and moved east just missing Riverside Elementary School and then moving along Chapel Hill Drive where it reached its peak intensity.  The tornado then weakened as it moved across Interstate 194 before finally dissipating as it crossed 6 1/2 mile road.  Three houses and Chapel Hill Methodist Church suffered partial loss of their roofs which along with approximately 100 snapped and uprooted trees resulted in a rating of EF1 along Chapel Hill Drive.  The remainder of the track was rated EF0 where clusters of trees were uprooted or snapped with only minor damage occurring to houses in the path.,2010,6
