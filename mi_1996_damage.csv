The event started on November 9 with a closed upper air (500 mb) low over Lake Superior combined with northwest winds between Arctic high pressure in Alberta and a surface low in southern Quebec with an east-west oriented trough across Lake Superior. Heavy snow began  around midnight on Nov 9 in the Ironwood area and spread east to the Keweenaw Peninsula during the daylight hours on the 9th. Meanwhile, another band of heavy snow was established over Munising in central Alger county during the day on the 9th. The upper low slowly lifted north and opened into a trough by 7 am on the 10th. The surface trough meanwhile moved south of Upper Michigan.
