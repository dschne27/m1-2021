One very heavy lake effect snow band (or snow squall) developed over eastern Lake Michigan and moved onshore across southwest Allegan County and western Van Buren County on the evening of the 29th and remained nearly stationary until dissipating between 5:00 and 7:00 am EST on the morning of the 30th. See above details for snowfall totals under this band. Elsewhere, snowfall totals in the listed counties averaged 1 to 3 inches. Specific snowfall reports included 4 inches in Bloomingdale (Van Buren County); 3 inches in Ludington and Scottville (Mason County), 3 miles NE of Pentwater (Oceana County), and Whitehall (Muskegon County); and 2 inches in Bangor (Van Buren County), Pullman (Allegan County), Little Sable Point (Oceana County), and North Muskegon (Muskegon County).",,1998,2

This storm occurred on the 23rd anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in Lake Superior, and was actually very comparable to that storm, both in regards to storm intensity and storm track.  The big story with both systems were the extremely strong winds that occurred.  Thankfully, this storm - as opposed to the Fitzgerald storm - was forecast days in advance, and the huge majority of marine traffic on the Great Lakes sought safe harbor before wind speeds became excessive.High winds occurred in two phases.  Winds reached high wind criteria across southeast Michigan early in the afternoon of the 10th, associated with a cold front racing east across the state.  A line of showers accompanied the front, locally enhancing wind speeds (see below).  The strong winds slackened some during the afternoon.  Wind speeds increased again in the evening, as an area of strong descent well behind the cold front allowed strong winds aloft to penetrate to ground level.  The highest winds during the entire event occurred within a couple of hours of midnight.  Winds diminished to below high wind criteria by dawn on the 11 th.Both periods of high winds caused significant damage across the area.  In the afternoon, the walls of a church under construction were destroyed in Troy.  A warehouse in Flint was deroofed, and a second warehouse roof was damaged.  Large tree limbs were downed in Saginaw.  Wind speeds approaching 50 mph were measured at the Coast Guard Station in Port Huron.Damage was more widespread with the higher wind speeds that occurred at night.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed across all of southeast Michigan.  The falling trees and limbs caused damage to some homes and vehicles.  In Livingston County, an indirect fatality occurred, as the driver of a car was killed when he crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road.  In Owosso, a roof under construction collapsed, and a church under construction in Ida (Monroe County) was also damaged.  An automated weather observing station in Adrian was disabled.  Near Mt Clemens, a boat rack storing a number boats of collapsed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.  A 70 mph wind gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake at about 1020 pm.The extended period of strong winds caused an interesting phenomena on Saginaw Bay.  Southwest gales occurred over the waters of Saginaw Bay for 12 to 18 hours, acting to push water out of the bay and into the main body of Lake Huron.  Water levels in Saginaw Bay dropped dramatically as a result.  Previous to the storm, the water level was running about 18 inches above chart datum.  Any level lower than about 4 inches above chart datum begins to interfere with navigation on Saginaw Bay.  At about 5 am on the 11th, the water level on Saginaw Bay bottomed out at an amazing 50 inches below chart datum - over 5 feet below the recent average!  Although detailed historical records were not available for this writing, the Coast Guard in Essexville (Bay County) reported that this was the lowest water level in recent memory.  Most of Saginaw Bay is quite shallow, and the removal of over 5 feet of water exposed a huge portion of the bay bed; some estimate that up to half of the area of the bay briefly became dry land during the storm!  To illustrate this point, a pair of duck hunters were stranded on an island off of Sebewaing (Huron County), as the water level dropped too far for them to be able to boat back to the mainland.  However, as the water level dropped further during the night, one of the hunters was able to walk ashore, as the intervening three miles of Saginaw Bay suddenly became dry land.  As the wind slackened and swung to the west toward dawn, the water level began to rise toward a more normal level.",,1998,1

The storm originated over the Central Plains and lifted across western portions of Lake Superior. South to southeast winds increased steadily during the morning of the 10th and by late morning winds gusts of 40 to 50 mph were common over areas away from Lake Huron.  Along the Lake Huron shoreline...winds were gusting to 60 to 70 mph with a peak gust of 95 mph reported on Mackinac Island. The wind shifted to the southwest during the afternoon...with the strongest winds generally developing along the Lake Michigan shoreline. During the afternoon and evening of the 10th wind gusts of 70 to 80 mph were common along the Lake Michigan shoreline...with 50 to 60 mph gusts across the rest of the region. Similar winds persisted into the morning of the 11th and then began to diminish during the afternoon.    A large number of trees were uprooted or snapped off  with many branches also torn off. Many of the trees and branches fell on power lines resulting in widespread power outages regionwide. Many roads were also blocked by falling trees and several accidents were reported as cars collided with debris on the  roadways. Several homes and cars received damage from falling trees and branches. The strong winds generated 15 to 20 foot waves on Lake Michigan. Most ships took shelter with the approach of the storm and rode out the storm in protected waters.   In Frankfort...located on the Lake Michigan shoreline of Benzie county...80 to 90 mph wind gusts destroyed a hangar at the City-County airport and damaged 6 private planes. Damage to the hangar was estimated at around $500,000 dollars. In Lake City the roof was blown off a hardware store onto an adjoining bank.

The warm weather culminated on the 6th, when Detroit reached a high of 69 degrees - the warmest reading ever in Detroit in December.  However, a powerful cold front swung through the state late in the evening on the 6th.  A thin line of showers and thunderstorms accompanied the front, moving east at about 50 mph.  Many of the storms along the line produced wind damage.  The result was a December severe weather episode - a rather uncommon event for Michigan.  Most of the wind damage occurred immediately behind the line of convection, and the majority of the damage involved the downing of trees, large limbs, and power lines.The majority of the severe weather occurred near or south of Interstate 69.  The most notable exception to this was a swath of wind damage across southern Sanilac County, from Marlette to Lexington.  Barns and silos were destroyed near Marlette, and a home was deroofed.A more spotty damage path roughly followed I-69 from Davison to Port Huron.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph wind in Davison.  Limbs and power lines were downed further east, in Lapeer and Port Huron.  Damage was also spotty across Livingston, Oakland, and Macomb Counties.  In Oakland County, the National Weather Service office in White Lake measured a 63 mph gust.  In Farmington, a home was heavily damaged when it was struck by a large evergreen.  A tree fell onto a vehicle on Middlebelt Road in West Bloomfield Township, and the two occupants suffered minor injuries.  In Birmingham, the walls of a construction project were blown over, while in Troy, a billboard was shredded by severe winds.  The city of Utica in Macomb County was especially hard hit, with many trees and power lines downed.Damage was a little heavier across Washtenaw and Wayne Counties.  A barn was destroyed near Manchester.  A 64 mph gust was measured at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, while Detroit Metropolitan Airport had a 60 mph gust.  In between those two sites, heavy damage occurred in Ypsilanti and at nearby Willow Run Airport.  Three apartments suffered extensive roof damage near Ypsilanti, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  At Willow Run Airport, many planes were tossed about, resulting in the destruction of 4 planes, and damage to another half-dozen or so.  In Livonia, a metal shed was thrown into a yard two homes down from where it started.  In addition, the walls of a drug store under construction were toppled.  Nativity scenes were thrown about in Plymouth and Romulus.  An historic elm tree lost large limbs in Lincoln Park, a nearby school suffered substantial roof damage, and a dry cleaners under construction was damaged.  In Trenton, a trampoline became airborne and flew into nearby tree limbs and power lines, downing them.Damage was isolated in the southernmost tier of counties.

One period of light freezing rain fell from after midnight to around 10:00 AM EST, resulting in light ice accumulations of around one-tenth of an inch. No serious problems were reported, other than icy spots on secondary roads and bridges/overpasses.	A more significant period of freezing rain developed later in the afternoon across central lower Michigan from Montcalm and Gratiot counties north across Mecosta, Isabella, Mason, Lake, Osceola, and Clare counties. This precipitation was associated with an area of low pressure moving northeast across Iowa. Temperatures held near or slightly below freezing from 5:00 PM to 11:45 PM EST across the affected areas, resulting in additional ice accumulation from one- to three-tenths of an inch. Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions.

The squall line propagated east at over 50 mph across Lake Michigan during the late evening hours and slowed down to around 35 mph after moving inland into western Lower Michigan. Weather spotter reports and automated observing systems indicated that the peak wind gusts associated with this line of thunderstorms averaged between 35 and 55 mph. However, isolated occurrences of 60 to 80 mph wind gusts downed trees and power lines at scattered locations across mainly the western two tiers of counties across southwest Lower Michigan, between Muskegon and Benton Harbor. The peak wind gust reported was 81 mph in Saugatuck, along the lake shore of Allegan County. At the height of the storm, approximately 13,400 people were without power in areas near and around Muskegon, Montague, Holland, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, and Battle Creek. Many power outages were caused by lightning strikes.","Amateur radio operators reported a pole barn was blown down along 30th Street, just south of Gitchel and just north of the Ottawa/Allegan County line.",1998,6

Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions.

Similar winds persisted into the morning of the 11th and then began to diminish during the afternoon.    A large number of trees were uprooted or snapped off  with many branches also torn off. Many of the trees and branches fell on power lines resulting in widespread power outages regionwide. Many roads were also blocked by falling trees and several accidents were reported as cars collided with debris on the  roadways. Several homes and cars received damage from falling trees and branches. The strong winds generated 15 to 20 foot waves on Lake Michigan. Most ships took shelter with the approach of the storm and rode out the storm in protected waters.   In Frankfort...located on the Lake Michigan shoreline of Benzie county...80 to 90 mph wind gusts destroyed a hangar at the City-County airport and damaged 6 private planes.

This storm occurred on the 23rd anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in Lake Superior, and was actually very comparable to that storm, both in regards to storm intensity and storm track.  The big story with both systems were the extremely strong winds that occurred.  Thankfully, this storm - as opposed to the Fitzgerald storm - was forecast days in advance, and the huge majority of marine traffic on the Great Lakes sought safe harbor before wind speeds became excessive.High winds occurred in two phases.  Winds reached high wind criteria across southeast Michigan early in the afternoon of the 10th, associated with a cold front racing east across the state.  A line of showers accompanied the front, locally enhancing wind speeds (see below).  The strong winds slackened some during the afternoon.  Wind speeds increased again in the evening, as an area of strong descent well behind the cold front allowed strong winds aloft to penetrate to ground level.  The highest winds during the entire event occurred within a couple of hours of midnight.  Winds diminished to below high wind criteria by dawn on the 11 th.Both periods of high winds caused significant damage across the area.  In the afternoon, the walls of a church under construction were destroyed in Troy.  A warehouse in Flint was deroofed, and a second warehouse roof was damaged.  Large tree limbs were downed in Saginaw.  Wind speeds approaching 50 mph were measured at the Coast Guard Station in Port Huron.Damage was more widespread with the higher wind speeds that occurred at night.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed across all of southeast Michigan.  The falling trees and limbs caused damage to some homes and vehicles.  In Livingston County, an indirect fatality occurred, as the driver of a car was killed when he crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road.  In Owosso, a roof under construction collapsed, and a church under construction in Ida (Monroe County) was also damaged.  An automated weather observing station in Adrian was disabled.  Near Mt Clemens, a boat rack storing a number boats of collapsed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.  A 70 mph wind gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake at about 1020 pm.The extended period of strong winds caused an interesting phenomena on Saginaw Bay.  Southwest gales occurred over the waters of Saginaw Bay for 12 to 18 hours, acting to push water out of the bay and into the main body of Lake Huron.  Water levels in Saginaw Bay dropped dramatically as a result.  Previous to the storm, the water level was running about 18 inches above chart datum.  Any level lower than about 4 inches above chart datum begins to interfere with navigation on Saginaw Bay.  At about 5 am on the 11th, the water level on Saginaw Bay bottomed out at an amazing 50 inches below chart datum - over 5 feet below the recent average!  Although detailed historical records were not available for this writing, the Coast Guard in Essexville (Bay County) reported that this was the lowest water level in recent memory.  Most of Saginaw Bay is quite shallow, and the removal of over 5 feet of water exposed a huge portion of the bay bed; some estimate that up to half of the area of the bay briefly became dry land during the storm!  To illustrate this point, a pair of duck hunters were stranded on an island off of Sebewaing (Huron County), as the water level dropped too far for them to be able to boat back to the mainland.  However, as the water level dropped further during the night, one of the hunters was able to walk ashore, as the intervening three miles of Saginaw Bay suddenly became dry land.  As the wind slackened and swung to the west toward dawn, the water level began to rise toward a more normal level.",,1998,1

One period of light freezing rain fell from after midnight to around 10:00 AM EST, resulting in light ice accumulations of around one-tenth of an inch. No serious problems were reported, other than icy spots on secondary roads and bridges/overpasses.	A more significant period of freezing rain developed later in the afternoon across central lower Michigan from Montcalm and Gratiot counties north across Mecosta, Isabella, Mason, Lake, Osceola, and Clare counties. This precipitation was associated with an area of low pressure moving northeast across Iowa. Temperatures held near or slightly below freezing from 5:00 PM to 11:45 PM EST across the affected areas, resulting in additional ice accumulation from one- to three-tenths of an inch. Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions. The accident occurred in Sidney Township in Montcalm County Sunday afternoon and injured both the driver and passenger.

A slow moving cold front was across far northern lower Michigan. A well-defined outflow boundary and squall line developed ahead of a weakening Mesoscale Convective System during the evening of the 28th. This outflow boundary and squall line moved east across Lake Michigan and onshore across West Central and Southwest Lower Michigan shortly after Midnight EDT and crossed the Lower Peninsula by 5:00 am EDT. Downburst (wet microbursts) wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were common with the thunderstorms and downed trees and power lines caused most of the associated damage. Only a few hail reports were received. The worst of the damage occurred in Muskegon County and the northwest corner of Ottawa County, including the cities of Muskegon and Grand Haven. Especially hard-hit was the cities of North Muskegon, Muskegon, and Norton Shores, were hundreds of homes received minor damage from fallen trees and power lines. The power line infrastructure in the Muskegon area was greatly damaged, resulting loss of power for approximately 33% of the county's residents. Overall, an estimated 90,000 people lost power across the state, with 54,000 of the customers located in Muskegon County alone. No injuries were reported, but property damage estimates in Muskegon County reached $1.0 Million.",Trees and power lines downed in the city of Kalamazoo.,1998,5

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.

The squall line propagated east at over 50 mph across Lake Michigan during the late evening hours and slowed down to around 35 mph after moving inland into western Lower Michigan. Weather spotter reports and automated observing systems indicated that the peak wind gusts associated with this line of thunderstorms averaged between 35 and 55 mph. However, isolated occurrences of 60 to 80 mph wind gusts downed trees and power lines at scattered locations across mainly the western two tiers of counties across southwest Lower Michigan, between Muskegon and Benton Harbor. The peak wind gust reported was 81 mph in Saugatuck, along the lake shore of Allegan County. At the height of the storm, approximately 13,400 people were without power in areas near and around Muskegon, Montague, Holland, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, and Battle Creek.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.

Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.

Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

Temperatures behind the cold front fell into the upper 20's and lower 30's, changing light rain to freezing rain across much of central and southern lower Michigan. One period of light freezing rain fell from after midnight to around 10:00 AM EST, resulting in light ice accumulations of around one-tenth of an inch. No serious problems were reported, other than icy spots on secondary roads and bridges/overpasses.	A more significant period of freezing rain developed later in the afternoon across central lower Michigan from Montcalm and Gratiot counties north across Mecosta, Isabella, Mason, Lake, Osceola, and Clare counties. This precipitation was associated with an area of low pressure moving northeast across Iowa. Temperatures held near or slightly below freezing from 5:00 PM to 11:45 PM EST across the affected areas, resulting in additional ice accumulation from one- to three-tenths of an inch. Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions. The accident occurred in Sidney Township in Montcalm County Sunday afternoon and injured both the driver and passenger. Dense fog and icy road conditions brought school closings and delayed openings to some districts in Montcalm, Gratiot, and Isabella counties on Monday, January 5th.",,1998,1

This supercell thunderstorm propagated east-southeast across Calhoun and Jackson Counties from approximately 4:20 pm until 5:45 pm EDT and spawned an F1 tornado and two damaging microbursts. The microburst which hit Pennfield Township in Calhoun County killed a 75-year old male and injured 2 females (one of which, a 13-year old female, was critically injured) when their respective modular homes were destroyed. NWS Grand Rapids officials estimated wind speeds reached 120 mph in the Pennfield Township downburst.

The worst of the damage occurred in Muskegon County and the northwest corner of Ottawa County, including the cities of Muskegon and Grand Haven. Especially hard-hit was the cities of North Muskegon, Muskegon, and Norton Shores, were hundreds of homes received minor damage from fallen trees and power lines. The power line infrastructure in the Muskegon area was greatly damaged, resulting loss of power for approximately 33% of the county's residents. Overall, an estimated 90,000 people lost power across the state, with 54,000 of the customers located in Muskegon County alone. No injuries were reported, but property damage estimates in Muskegon County reached $1.0 Million.","Widespread wind damage occurred in the Muskegon metropolitan area including the cities of Muskegon, North Muskegon, Muskegon Heights, and Norton Shores and Laketon, Muskegon, and Fruitport Townships. Many large trees, utility poles, and power lines were downed by sustained 60 to 80 mph winds (estimated) over a 10 to 15 minute period. Overall, an estimated 900 power lines were downed in the Muskegon area which left approximately 54,000 homes and businesses without power, affecting approximately a third of all Muskegon County residents. Most structural damage to homes and businesses was caused by fallen trees and utility poles. An estimated 500 homes and 30 businesses sustained minor to moderate damage. Most area schools and many area businesses were closed on Friday, May 29th. An estimated 27,000 people were still without power as of late in the day, Saturday, May 30th.

Snow showers continued until the late afternoon hours of December 22nd. Snowfall totals ranged from 1 to 5 inches in the listed counties. The highest snow amounts were reported from the counties adjacent to Lake Michigan, with an average of 3 to 5 inches reported in Lake, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Ottawa, Allegan, and Van Buren Counties. As is typically the case in this area, the first snow of the season contributed to a dramatic increase in the reported number of traffic accidents. Most of the accidents were minor, however one fatal accident in Allegan County was blamed on hazardous road conditions. A 35-year old male was killed when he lost control of his sport utility vehicle on northbound I-196 near Saugatuck in Allegan County. The vehicle left the road and smashed into a tree.	The most snow reported from this event was 5.1 inches in Allegan.

Snow first moved into the southern border counties of the state shortly after 7:00 PM EST on Thursday. Snow ended from southwest to northeast during the morning hours on Friday.

Most major highways and roads became snow-covered during the storm and travel conditions were hazardous from late Thursday evening through the Friday morning rush hour. Numerous weather-related minor accidents were reported across the region. Many local school districts were closed because of road conditions on Friday, January 23rd.

Temperatures behind the cold front fell into the upper 20's and lower 30's, changing light rain to freezing rain across much of central and southern lower Michigan. One period of light freezing rain fell from after midnight to around 10:00 AM EST, resulting in light ice accumulations of around one-tenth of an inch. No serious problems were reported, other than icy spots on secondary roads and bridges/overpasses.	A more significant period of freezing rain developed later in the afternoon across central lower Michigan from Montcalm and Gratiot counties north across Mecosta, Isabella, Mason, Lake, Osceola, and Clare counties. This precipitation was associated with an area of low pressure moving northeast across Iowa. Temperatures held near or slightly below freezing from 5:00 PM to 11:45 PM EST across the affected areas, resulting in additional ice accumulation from one- to three-tenths of an inch. Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The highest snow amounts were reported from the counties adjacent to Lake Michigan, with an average of 3 to 5 inches reported in Lake, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Ottawa, Allegan, and Van Buren Counties. As is typically the case in this area, the first snow of the season contributed to a dramatic increase in the reported number of traffic accidents. Most of the accidents were minor, however one fatal accident in Allegan County was blamed on hazardous road conditions. A 35-year old male was killed when he lost control of his sport utility vehicle on northbound I-196 near Saugatuck in Allegan County. The vehicle left the road and smashed into a tree.	The most snow reported from this event was 5.1 inches in Allegan.

Thunderstorm activity was mostly multicellular in nature.The first severe thunderstorm of the day crossed Saginaw and Midland Counties, and produced dime-sized hail in the city of Saginaw.  A car was struck by lightning just north of the Zilwaukee Bridge on I-75, damaging ham radio equipment and flattening a tire.  A separate storm blew over a corn crib in eastern Shiawassee County, while spotters reported severe winds with another thunderstorm in Fenton.  The Fenton storm then produced golfball-sized hail and downed trees east of Holly.A northwest-southeast oriented band of thunderstorms developed in the Thumb area, and these storms provided the majority of severe weather during the late afternoon hours.  Most of the storms within this band were pulse-type storms, producing dime-sized hail and severe downbursts at isolated locations.  A strong downburst took place in eastern Tuscola County, where a horse barn was leveled, trees were uprooted, siding of a nearby house and garage was damaged, and a children's swing set was wrapped around a tree.  The same decaying storm moved into Evergreen Township in Sanilac County, where it heavily damaged a barn and tore the roofing off of a shed.  An isolated storm behind this band produced some dime-sized hail in Lapeer.The southernmost storm of this band would become the most potent storm of the day.  It acquired supercell characteristics as it moved east across Sanilac County.  This storm first caused damage when it downed trees southeast of Sandusky.  Rotation in the storm continued to intensify, and a tornado formed between Carsonville and Applegate - the first tornado in Sanilac County since September 2, 1984.  The tornado had a continual damage path from its first touchdown until it moved out over Lake Huron at Port Sanilac.  Ping-pong to golfball-sized hail preceded the tornado by a few minutes from Carsonville to Port Sanilac.  Four homes, ten barns, five silos, and a grain bin were destroyed.  Twelve homes and six barns were damaged.  Significant damage was done to the public marina in Port Sanilac.  Two hundred people were left without power overnight.  There were no human casualties, but a horse had to be euthanised after it was seriously injured.The supercell storm put out an outflow boundary, and an isolated severe thunderstorm developed along this boundary after the supercell had moved out over the open lake.

One period of light freezing rain fell from after midnight to around 10:00 AM EST, resulting in light ice accumulations of around one-tenth of an inch. No serious problems were reported, other than icy spots on secondary roads and bridges/overpasses.	A more significant period of freezing rain developed later in the afternoon across central lower Michigan from Montcalm and Gratiot counties north across Mecosta, Isabella, Mason, Lake, Osceola, and Clare counties. This precipitation was associated with an area of low pressure moving northeast across Iowa. Temperatures held near or slightly below freezing from 5:00 PM to 11:45 PM EST across the affected areas, resulting in additional ice accumulation from one- to three-tenths of an inch. Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions. The accident occurred in Sidney Township in Montcalm County Sunday afternoon and injured both the driver and passenger.

Temperatures behind the cold front fell into the upper 20's and lower 30's, changing light rain to freezing rain across much of central and southern lower Michigan. One period of light freezing rain fell from after midnight to around 10:00 AM EST, resulting in light ice accumulations of around one-tenth of an inch. No serious problems were reported, other than icy spots on secondary roads and bridges/overpasses.	A more significant period of freezing rain developed later in the afternoon across central lower Michigan from Montcalm and Gratiot counties north across Mecosta, Isabella, Mason, Lake, Osceola, and Clare counties. This precipitation was associated with an area of low pressure moving northeast across Iowa. Temperatures held near or slightly below freezing from 5:00 PM to 11:45 PM EST across the affected areas, resulting in additional ice accumulation from one- to three-tenths of an inch. Law enforcement officials reported a coating of ice on trees, the ground, sidewalks, and on area bridges and secondary roads. Tree limbs, which broke from the weight of the ice that had accumulated from both morning and evening events, were reported down on some area roads and blocked a few roads near Sheridan in Montcalm County. Downed tree limbs and power lines resulted in power outages. Nearly 2,500 customers lost power in the Greenville area of Montcalm County. Other sporadic power outages were reported in Edmore and Stanton. At least one serious accident was attributed to the icy road conditions. The accident occurred in Sidney Township in Montcalm County Sunday afternoon and injured both the driver and passenger. Dense fog and icy road conditions brought school closings and delayed openings to some districts in Montcalm, Gratiot, and Isabella counties on Monday, January 5th.",,1998,1

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.

Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

Plentiful sunshine during the afternoon allowed for rapid destablization, and a number of severe thunderstorms developed near the warm front.  Thunderstorm activity was mostly multicellular in nature.The first severe thunderstorm of the day crossed Saginaw and Midland Counties, and produced dime-sized hail in the city of Saginaw.  A car was struck by lightning just north of the Zilwaukee Bridge on I-75, damaging ham radio equipment and flattening a tire.  A separate storm blew over a corn crib in eastern Shiawassee County, while spotters reported severe winds with another thunderstorm in Fenton.  The Fenton storm then produced golfball-sized hail and downed trees east of Holly.A northwest-southeast oriented band of thunderstorms developed in the Thumb area, and these storms provided the majority of severe weather during the late afternoon hours.  Most of the storms within this band were pulse-type storms, producing dime-sized hail and severe downbursts at isolated locations.  A strong downburst took place in eastern Tuscola County, where a horse barn was leveled, trees were uprooted, siding of a nearby house and garage was damaged, and a children's swing set was wrapped around a tree.  The same decaying storm moved into Evergreen Township in Sanilac County, where it heavily damaged a barn and tore the roofing off of a shed.  An isolated storm behind this band produced some dime-sized hail in Lapeer.The southernmost storm of this band would become the most potent storm of the day.  It acquired supercell characteristics as it moved east across Sanilac County.  This storm first caused damage when it downed trees southeast of Sandusky.  Rotation in the storm continued to intensify, and a tornado formed between Carsonville and Applegate - the first tornado in Sanilac County since September 2, 1984.  The tornado had a continual damage path from its first touchdown until it moved out over Lake Huron at Port Sanilac.  Ping-pong to golfball-sized hail preceded the tornado by a few minutes from Carsonville to Port Sanilac.  Four homes, ten barns, five silos, and a grain bin were destroyed.  Twelve homes and six barns were damaged.  Significant damage was done to the public marina in Port Sanilac.  Two hundred people were left without power overnight.  There were no human casualties, but a horse had to be euthanised after it was seriously injured.The supercell storm put out an outflow boundary, and an isolated severe thunderstorm developed along this boundary after the supercell had moved out over the open lake.

Snow first spread across west central Lower Michigan during mid afternoon Friday, then spread east-southeast across southwest, central, and south central during the early evening hours. Southwest winds blowing across Lake Michigan ahead of the system resulted in lake enhancement across much of west central Lower Michigan, including Ottawa, Muskegon, Oceana, Mason, Lake, Newaygo, Kent, and Osceola Counties. Gusty winds associated with the system, first southwest ahead of the front, then northwest behind it, resulted in blowing and drifting. Wind speeds were sustained at 15 to 25 mph, with gusts to 35 mph. Snowfall rates approached 1 inch per hour with this system and total accumulations ranged from 2.5 to 10 inches in the listed counties. Snow accumulations south of Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Lansing were 2 inches or less. 	The timing of the onset of heavy snow across the Muskegon - Grand Rapids - Holland metropolitan area coincided with the Friday afternoon rush hour.

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.

Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.

Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.

In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.

At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.

The most significant damage occurred across Calhoun County, south and east of Battle Creek. Power outages across southwest and south central Lower Michigan peaked at approximately 110,000. Statewide, some 400,000 people lost power, most of which occurred in the Detroit metropolitan area.",,1998,7

Snow showers continued until the late afternoon hours of December 22nd. Snowfall totals ranged from 1 to 5 inches in the listed counties. The highest snow amounts were reported from the counties adjacent to Lake Michigan, with an average of 3 to 5 inches reported in Lake, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Ottawa, Allegan, and Van Buren Counties. As is typically the case in this area, the first snow of the season contributed to a dramatic increase in the reported number of traffic accidents. Most of the accidents were minor, however one fatal accident in Allegan County was blamed on hazardous road conditions. A 35-year old male was killed when he lost control of his sport utility vehicle on northbound I-196 near Saugatuck in Allegan County. The vehicle left the road and smashed into a tree.	The most snow reported from this event was 5.1 inches in Allegan. Other snowfall reports included 5.0 inches in Bloomingdale (Van Buren County), 4.2 inches in Grandville (Kent County), 3.5 inches in Holland, 3.0 inches at the Kent County International Airport in Grand Rapids, 2.5 inches in Hastings (Barry County), and 1.5 inches in Big Rapids (Mecosta County).",,1998,2

Light rain on Sunday, March 8th, changed to a brief period of freezing rain and sleet during the predawn hours on Monday, March 9th in areas north and west of Grand Rapids. This icy mixture changed to snow by 7:00 am EST across most of Mason, Lake, Osceola, Mecosta, Newaygo, Oceana, Muskegon, and Ottawa Counties. Rain changed to freezing rain and sleet in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Jackson, and surrounding communities between 7:00 am and 9:00 am EST. This icy mix changed to snow during the mid to late morning hours from east to west. However, a prolonged period of sleet across Barry, Branch, Calhoun, Clinton, Eaton, Ingham, Jackson, Kalamazoo, and St. Joseph counties, cut down on snowfall totals in these areas. Snowfall was heavy and was reported at rates around and slightly over 1 inch per hour. Northerly winds increased to sustained speeds of 25 to 35 mph during the morning hours and wind gusts of 45-60 mph were reported along the counties along Lake Michigan shores. One report of a 60-mph wind gust occurred in Ludington around Noon. Widespread blizzard conditions were reported across Mason, Lake, Oceana, and Muskegon Counties. Occasional white-outs were also reported elsewhere across western and central Lower Michigan. Snowfall totals averaged 6 to 12 inches for areas north and west of a line from Cassopolis to Kalamazoo to Lansing. The highest storm total reported was 18 inches in Howard City, in Montcalm County. Snowfall totals of 2 to 5 inches were reported in Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Calhoun, Branch, Eaton, Ingham, and Jackson counties. Several area cities and counties declared local snow emergencies.	Numerous weather-related traffic accidents were reported, one of which resulted in 2 fatalities in Kent County when a snowmobile collided with a Kent County Road Commission snow plow truck. Downed trees and power lines cut power to some residents, most of which occurred in the counties bordering Lake Michigan. Power outages were reported in Mason (600), Lake, Clare, Oceana, Muskegon (1,900),  Montcalm (1,630), Allegan (7,000), and Berrien (12,000) counties. Schools and businesses were closed by this winter storm, the most intense of the 1997-98 winter season. Saturated ground in Jackson from heavy rainfall Sunday night and early Monday morning weakened an old oak tree, which was blown over by winds gusting to 30 mph just before daybreak. This tree crashed through a home in the city of Jackson and caused an estimated $100,000 in damage. No injuries were reported from residents inside the home.

An volunteer observer for a local television station measured 8.16 inches of rain near this location.

Most roads in the immediate vicinity were closed due to high water, including Gratiot, Harper, Little Mack, and Metro Parkway.  Cars stranded on Gratiot were up to their windshields in water, and numerous homes had flooded yards and basements.  Minor urban flooding also took place in adjacent Harrison Township.  More serious flooding in the area was averted because the areal extent of heavy rain was extremely small.In the late afternoon and early evening hours, a band of showers and thunderstorms produced heavy rain in southern Oakland County.  Rainfall amounts were generally less than two inches; however, this area had seen flood-producing rainfall just three days previous, and was thus vulnerable to any additional rain.

A series of showers and thunderstorms developed just north of the front.  These storms moved east, parallel to the warm front, in a typical train-echo pattern.  The result was a classic heavy rain event for southeast Michigan.  Some rainfall totals were: 5.7 inches in Hudson, 5.09 inches in Manchester, 4.12 inches in Ann Arbor, 3.78 inches in Farmington Hills, and 3.55 inches in Ypsilanti.Southeast Michigan had been quite dry for the past month, and so the soil was able to absorb much of the heavy rain.  As a result, flooding problems in rural areas were surprisingly minor, and largely confined to Lenawee County.  A few vehicles left in flood prone locations overnight were swamped by high water in the morning.Urban areas were an entirely different story.  The increased area covered by impermeable surfaces, such as concrete and buildings, led to rapid runoff despite dry soil conditions.  As a result, urban areas in the heavy rain swath saw substantial flooding, including Adrian and Ann Arbor.  In Ann Arbor, Mallets Creek rose out of its banks.  The creek destroyed sidewalks in the Briarwood Mall area, and swept three cars into a retention pond.  Some flooding also took place on the Athletic (South) Campus of the University of Michigan.Although rainfall totals were not as high, flooding also developed further east in the near northwest suburbs of Detroit.  Flooded roads played havoc with the morning commute in Southfield, Troy, Livonia, Novi, and other cities.  Parts of I-75, I-696, and Woodward Avenue (M-1), were closed.  Basements were flooded in Farmington and Royal Oak, and several businesses in Farmington Hills experienced water damage.  In Northville, a train derailed when it attempted to cross tracks that were washed out.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County.

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",Two homes burned after being struck by lightning.,1998,7

A slow moving cold front was across far northern lower Michigan. A well-defined outflow boundary and squall line developed ahead of a weakening Mesoscale Convective System during the evening of the 28th. This outflow boundary and squall line moved east across Lake Michigan and onshore across West Central and Southwest Lower Michigan shortly after Midnight EDT and crossed the Lower Peninsula by 5:00 am EDT. Downburst (wet microbursts) wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were common with the thunderstorms and downed trees and power lines caused most of the associated damage. Only a few hail reports were received. The worst of the damage occurred in Muskegon County and the northwest corner of Ottawa County, including the cities of Muskegon and Grand Haven. Especially hard-hit was the cities of North Muskegon, Muskegon, and Norton Shores, were hundreds of homes received minor damage from fallen trees and power lines. The power line infrastructure in the Muskegon area was greatly damaged, resulting loss of power for approximately 33% of the county's residents. Overall, an estimated 90,000 people lost power across the state, with 54,000 of the customers located in Muskegon County alone. No injuries were reported, but property damage estimates in Muskegon County reached $1.0 Million.",Several small trees downed near Indian Lakes in Algoma Township.,1998,5

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.

Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.

This severe weather event was characterized by several large hail reports, with golf-ball sized hail reports received from Kent, Barry, Eaton, Ingham, and Jackson Counties and hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter associated with a supercell thunderstorm as it tracked east-southeast across southern Ingham and northern Jackson County. This supercell thunderstorm developed over eastern Barry County and tracked across Eaton County, southwest Ingham County, and northern Jackson County. This storm resulted in several wind damage and large hail reports, an F0 tornado in southeast Eaton County, and an F1 tornado touched down in north central Jackson County near Layton Corners. No injuries were reported with the tornadoes, but damage was estimated at half a million dollars across Henrietta and Waterloo Townships in northern Jackson County. The supercell thunderstorm resulted in approximately 12,500 power outages across Eaton and Jackson Counties.","The Jackson County Emergency Management Coordinator confirmed a weak tornado touched down just west of Layton Corners, in rural eastern Rives Township, and travelled east-southeast to near Waterloo, along the Washtenaw County line. The tornado was not on the ground for the entire 11.3 mile path, but due to the heavily wooded rural areas it traversed, exact path lengths could not be determined. Path width was narrow, estimated to be 50 yards at maximum width. No injuries or deaths were associated with this F1 tornado. Damage consisted of downed trees and power lines, roof damage to approximately 12 homes, minor structural damage mainly caused by large hail (broken windows, damaged siding, damaged vehicles and aluminum campers) and fallen trees, and overturned boats on Pleasant Lake in Henrietta Township. Hail was estimated to have reached 2 to 3 inches in diameter in association with this tornadic storm. The most significant damage was reported around the Pleasant Lake area, where several boats were overturned and several homes reported minor to moderate structural damage. Along North Meridian Road from near Layton Corners along the west end of Pleasant Lake, 2 homes reported destroyed garages. Pleasant Lake County Park was closed due to downed trees. Waterloo State Recreation Area reported hundreds of trees uprooted, which resulted in the closing of some roads and horse trails. Power outages totaled 5,800 in the affected areas of Henrietta and Waterloo Townships. Damage was estimated at approximately $500,000.",1998,6

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

The low pressure center tracked across Kentucky and into northern Virginia, keeping the most significant precipitation south of the state. A mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain fell across much of southwest and south central Lower Michigan, mainly south of a line from South Haven to Lansing, MI. The precipitation started out as a mixture of sleet and freezing rain Friday afternoon, then turned to mostly snow Friday evening. The ice at the onset made travel conditions hazardous for the Friday afternoon rush hour and several minor weather-related accidents were reported along and south of the Interstate-94 corridor. Snow accumulations ranged from 1 to 4 inches in the aforementioned counties. Accumulations of 3 to 4 inches were confined to southern Berrien County, Cass County, Jackson County, and southeast Ingham County.",,1998,3

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.

The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.

This storm occurred on the 23rd anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in Lake Superior, and was actually very comparable to that storm, both in regards to storm intensity and storm track.  The big story with both systems were the extremely strong winds that occurred.  Thankfully, this storm - as opposed to the Fitzgerald storm - was forecast days in advance, and the huge majority of marine traffic on the Great Lakes sought safe harbor before wind speeds became excessive.High winds occurred in two phases.  Winds reached high wind criteria across southeast Michigan early in the afternoon of the 10th, associated with a cold front racing east across the state.  A line of showers accompanied the front, locally enhancing wind speeds (see below).  The strong winds slackened some during the afternoon.  Wind speeds increased again in the evening, as an area of strong descent well behind the cold front allowed strong winds aloft to penetrate to ground level.  The highest winds during the entire event occurred within a couple of hours of midnight.  Winds diminished to below high wind criteria by dawn on the 11 th.Both periods of high winds caused significant damage across the area.  In the afternoon, the walls of a church under construction were destroyed in Troy.  A warehouse in Flint was deroofed, and a second warehouse roof was damaged.  Large tree limbs were downed in Saginaw.  Wind speeds approaching 50 mph were measured at the Coast Guard Station in Port Huron.Damage was more widespread with the higher wind speeds that occurred at night.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed across all of southeast Michigan.  The falling trees and limbs caused damage to some homes and vehicles.  In Livingston County, an indirect fatality occurred, as the driver of a car was killed when he crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road.  In Owosso, a roof under construction collapsed, and a church under construction in Ida (Monroe County) was also damaged.  An automated weather observing station in Adrian was disabled.  Near Mt Clemens, a boat rack storing a number boats of collapsed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.  A 70 mph wind gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake at about 1020 pm.The extended period of strong winds caused an interesting phenomena on Saginaw Bay.  Southwest gales occurred over the waters of Saginaw Bay for 12 to 18 hours, acting to push water out of the bay and into the main body of Lake Huron.  Water levels in Saginaw Bay dropped dramatically as a result.  Previous to the storm, the water level was running about 18 inches above chart datum.  Any level lower than about 4 inches above chart datum begins to interfere with navigation on Saginaw Bay.  At about 5 am on the 11th, the water level on Saginaw Bay bottomed out at an amazing 50 inches below chart datum - over 5 feet below the recent average!  Although detailed historical records were not available for this writing, the Coast Guard in Essexville (Bay County) reported that this was the lowest water level in recent memory.  Most of Saginaw Bay is quite shallow, and the removal of over 5 feet of water exposed a huge portion of the bay bed; some estimate that up to half of the area of the bay briefly became dry land during the storm!  To illustrate this point, a pair of duck hunters were stranded on an island off of Sebewaing (Huron County), as the water level dropped too far for them to be able to boat back to the mainland.  However, as the water level dropped further during the night, one of the hunters was able to walk ashore, as the intervening three miles of Saginaw Bay suddenly became dry land.  As the wind slackened and swung to the west toward dawn, the water level began to rise toward a more normal level.",,1998,1

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.","Michigan State Police EMD Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $2,458,958 in public damage costs, 42 homes destroyed, 1805 homes damaged, 5 businesses destroyed, and 73 businesses damaged. Two injuries were reported. Total public and private costs have been estimated at $24,205,908 according to FEMA and local media reports. Numerous local roads were closed during the day of May 31st for tree and debris removal. Approximately 50% of the city of Whitehall was left without water service and 50,000 customers were left without power in Muskegon County. The Muskegon Chronicle reported 5 large transmission towers were toppled northeast of the city of Muskegon. These towers carried high voltage electricity and were designed to withstand sustained 90 mph winds and gusts to 110 mph. The Muskegon Chronicle also reported severe crop damage to fruit trees (including apple, cherry, and peach) in the southeast part of Muskegon County. Estimated crop damage was $5.0 Million. Severe tree damage was reported in Muskegon State Park, Hoffmaster State Park, and Duck Lake State Park, all bordering Lake Michigan. Muskegon County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Muskegon County, making federal disaster assistance available.",1998,5

Southwest winds blowing across Lake Michigan ahead of the system resulted in lake enhancement across much of west central Lower Michigan, including Ottawa, Muskegon, Oceana, Mason, Lake, Newaygo, Kent, and Osceola Counties. Gusty winds associated with the system, first southwest ahead of the front, then northwest behind it, resulted in blowing and drifting.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

Along the Lake Huron shoreline...winds were gusting to 60 to 70 mph with a peak gust of 95 mph reported on Mackinac Island. The wind shifted to the southwest during the afternoon...with the strongest winds generally developing along the Lake Michigan shoreline. During the afternoon and evening of the 10th wind gusts of 70 to 80 mph were common along the Lake Michigan shoreline...with 50 to 60 mph gusts across the rest of the region. Similar winds persisted into the morning of the 11th and then began to diminish during the afternoon.    A large number of trees were uprooted or snapped off  with many branches also torn off. Many of the trees and branches fell on power lines resulting in widespread power outages regionwide. Many roads were also blocked by falling trees and several accidents were reported as cars collided with debris on the  roadways. Several homes and cars received damage from falling trees and branches. The strong winds generated 15 to 20 foot waves on Lake Michigan. Most ships took shelter with the approach of the storm and rode out the storm in protected waters.   In Frankfort...located on the Lake Michigan shoreline of Benzie county...80 to 90 mph wind gusts destroyed a hangar at the City-County airport and damaged 6 private planes.

One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

Snow showers continued until the late afternoon hours of December 22nd. Snowfall totals ranged from 1 to 5 inches in the listed counties. The highest snow amounts were reported from the counties adjacent to Lake Michigan, with an average of 3 to 5 inches reported in Lake, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Ottawa, Allegan, and Van Buren Counties. As is typically the case in this area, the first snow of the season contributed to a dramatic increase in the reported number of traffic accidents. Most of the accidents were minor, however one fatal accident in Allegan County was blamed on hazardous road conditions. A 35-year old male was killed when he lost control of his sport utility vehicle on northbound I-196 near Saugatuck in Allegan County. The vehicle left the road and smashed into a tree.	The most snow reported from this event was 5.1 inches in Allegan. Other snowfall reports included 5.0 inches in Bloomingdale (Van Buren County), 4.2 inches in Grandville (Kent County), 3.5 inches in Holland, 3.0 inches at the Kent County International Airport in Grand Rapids, 2.5 inches in Hastings (Barry County), and 1.5 inches in Big Rapids (Mecosta County).",,1998,2

The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.

This outflow boundary and squall line moved east across Lake Michigan and onshore across West Central and Southwest Lower Michigan shortly after Midnight EDT and crossed the Lower Peninsula by 5:00 am EDT. Downburst (wet microbursts) wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were common with the thunderstorms and downed trees and power lines caused most of the associated damage. Only a few hail reports were received. The worst of the damage occurred in Muskegon County and the northwest corner of Ottawa County, including the cities of Muskegon and Grand Haven. Especially hard-hit was the cities of North Muskegon, Muskegon, and Norton Shores, were hundreds of homes received minor damage from fallen trees and power lines. The power line infrastructure in the Muskegon area was greatly damaged, resulting loss of power for approximately 33% of the county's residents.

Thunderstorms near both boundaries became severe.Storms near the northern boundary were hail producers.  Golfball sized hail was reported by a spotter in Sanford, and also by the Michigan State Police northwest of Pinconning.  Dime to quarter sized hail was reported at a number of other locations in Midland and Bay Counties.Along the warm front, a large supercell developed in south-central Michigan.  It moved east and then turned southeast across southeast Michigan.  Hardest hit was Washtenaw County, most notably around Chelsea, and from Milan to Whittaker.  These locations were affected by parts of the supercell for an extended period of time.  Severe weather started in the area around and north of Chelsea, where golfball sized hail fell.  A lightning strike started a house fire north of Chelsea.  Quarter sized hail fell in Chelsea about 20 minutes later, but this part of the storm was more noted for the wind damage it caused.  Trees were downed in Sylvan, Chelsea, and Lima.  A truck was destroyed by a fallen tree in Sylvan, and a few homes in Chelsea were damaged in a similar manner.

A spotter in Ann Arbor estimated 60 mph winds on the fringe of the supercell, while a spotter in Ypsilanti saw golfball sized hail and 75 mph winds.  Another spotter in Pittsfield saw dime sized hail.The supercell continued southeast into Lenawee and Monroe Counties.  Only the northeast corner of Lenawee County was grazed, as trees were downed near Macon.  Monroe County took a more substantial hit.  A golfer at Thorn Hills Golf Club, northeast of Maybee, was hurt when a large tree limb fell on him.  Trees were also downed in Dundee and Raisinville Township.  A spotter estimated 60 mph winds in Maybee, as did emergency management officials just south of Carleton.  Dime sized hail fell at the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant.  Finally, a sheriff just east of Temperance estimated a gust of 60 mph.This supercell would go on to cause substantial damage in northern Ohio.",,1998,6

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

A series of showers and thunderstorms developed just north of the front.  These storms moved east, parallel to the warm front, in a typical train-echo pattern.  The result was a classic heavy rain event for southeast Michigan.  Some rainfall totals were: 5.7 inches in Hudson, 5.09 inches in Manchester, 4.12 inches in Ann Arbor, 3.78 inches in Farmington Hills, and 3.55 inches in Ypsilanti.Southeast Michigan had been quite dry for the past month, and so the soil was able to absorb much of the heavy rain.  As a result, flooding problems in rural areas were surprisingly minor, and largely confined to Lenawee County.  A few vehicles left in flood prone locations overnight were swamped by high water in the morning.Urban areas were an entirely different story.  The increased area covered by impermeable surfaces, such as concrete and buildings, led to rapid runoff despite dry soil conditions.  As a result, urban areas in the heavy rain swath saw substantial flooding, including Adrian and Ann Arbor.  In Ann Arbor, Mallets Creek rose out of its banks.  The creek destroyed sidewalks in the Briarwood Mall area, and swept three cars into a retention pond.  Some flooding also took place on the Athletic (South) Campus of the University of Michigan.Although rainfall totals were not as high, flooding also developed further east in the near northwest suburbs of Detroit.

Golfball sized hail was reported by a spotter in Sanford, and also by the Michigan State Police northwest of Pinconning.  Dime to quarter sized hail was reported at a number of other locations in Midland and Bay Counties.Along the warm front, a large supercell developed in south-central Michigan.  It moved east and then turned southeast across southeast Michigan.  Hardest hit was Washtenaw County, most notably around Chelsea, and from Milan to Whittaker.  These locations were affected by parts of the supercell for an extended period of time.  Severe weather started in the area around and north of Chelsea, where golfball sized hail fell.

A lightning strike started a house fire north of Chelsea.  Quarter sized hail fell in Chelsea about 20 minutes later, but this part of the storm was more noted for the wind damage it caused.  Trees were downed in Sylvan, Chelsea, and Lima.  A truck was destroyed by a fallen tree in Sylvan, and a few homes in Chelsea were damaged in a similar manner.  Wind gusts also destroyed in barn in Lima.  The wind was estimated at 75 mph in Chelsea.The supercell covered the Milan-Whittaker area with golfball sized hail.  A spotter in Whittaker estimated 70 mph winds.  Again, a second component of the large supercell caused severe weather 15 to 20 minutes later.  This one also produced golfball sized hail in Milan, and emergency management officials estimated 70 mph winds just west of Whittaker.Although not hit as hard, the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area also saw severe weather.  A spotter in Ann Arbor estimated 60 mph winds on the fringe of the supercell, while a spotter in Ypsilanti saw golfball sized hail and 75 mph winds.  Another spotter in Pittsfield saw dime sized hail.The supercell continued southeast into Lenawee and Monroe Counties.  Only the northeast corner of Lenawee County was grazed, as trees were downed near Macon.  Monroe County took a more substantial hit.  A golfer at Thorn Hills Golf Club, northeast of Maybee, was hurt when a large tree limb fell on him.  Trees were also downed in Dundee and Raisinville Township.  A spotter estimated 60 mph winds in Maybee, as did emergency management officials just south of Carleton.  Dime sized hail fell at the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant.

Snow first spread across west central Lower Michigan during mid afternoon Friday, then spread east-southeast across southwest, central, and south central during the early evening hours. Southwest winds blowing across Lake Michigan ahead of the system resulted in lake enhancement across much of west central Lower Michigan, including Ottawa, Muskegon, Oceana, Mason, Lake, Newaygo, Kent, and Osceola Counties. Gusty winds associated with the system, first southwest ahead of the front, then northwest behind it, resulted in blowing and drifting. Wind speeds were sustained at 15 to 25 mph, with gusts to 35 mph. Snowfall rates approached 1 inch per hour with this system and total accumulations ranged from 2.5 to 10 inches in the listed counties. Snow accumulations south of Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, and Lansing were 2 inches or less. 	The timing of the onset of heavy snow across the Muskegon - Grand Rapids - Holland metropolitan area coincided with the Friday afternoon rush hour. Numerous weather-related accidents were reported, many of which involved minor injuries. Scattered power outages were reported in Muskegon County, where wind gusts to nearly 40 mph downed some tree limbs and branches on power lines. Up to 650 people were without power for a short time.	Snowfall reports included 10 inches in central Newaygo County; 8 inches in New Era (Oceana County),Fremont (Newaygo), and Cedar Springs (Kent); 6 inches in Irons (Lake), Kent City (Kent), and across much of Osceola, Lake and Muskegon Counties; 5.5 inches in Muskegon; 4.8 inches in Grand Haven; 4.0 inches in Holland and Saugatuck; 3.8 inches in downtown Grand Rapids; and 3.5 inches at the National Weather Service Office in Grand Rapids.",,1998,3

A mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain fell across much of southwest and south central Lower Michigan, mainly south of a line from South Haven to Lansing, MI. The precipitation started out as a mixture of sleet and freezing rain Friday afternoon, then turned to mostly snow Friday evening. The ice at the onset made travel conditions hazardous for the Friday afternoon rush hour and several minor weather-related accidents were reported along and south of the Interstate-94 corridor.

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.

Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.

Low pressure intensified along the Indiana-Ohio border on the morning of the 9th, and moved to near Cleveland, Ohio by evening.  Lake Erie water levels were already rather high due to the wet winter and early spring.  Northeast gales to 45 knots (52 mph) caused that water to pile up in the shallow western basin of the lake.  The Coast Guard station in Toledo, Ohio recorded a maximum water level of about 100 inches above chart datum.  This was the highest level recorded since the all-time record of 110 inches, set exactly 25 years previous, on April 9th, 1973.On top of the extremely high lake level were waves as high as 13 feet, produced by the strong northeast gales.  The high water level and wave action caused considerable damage along the Monroe County shoreline.  Further compounding the problem was the heavy rain seen that day - as the fire department in the city of Monroe reported 2.03 inches of rain, while 1.79 inches fell in Dundee.  With such exceptionally high lake levels, runoff from the heavy rain had nowhere to go.  The flooding affected all of the lakeshore communities, including LaSalle Township, Morin Point, Estral Beach, and Luna Pier.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.

Weather spotter reports and automated observing systems indicated that the peak wind gusts associated with this line of thunderstorms averaged between 35 and 55 mph. However, isolated occurrences of 60 to 80 mph wind gusts downed trees and power lines at scattered locations across mainly the western two tiers of counties across southwest Lower Michigan, between Muskegon and Benton Harbor. The peak wind gust reported was 81 mph in Saugatuck, along the lake shore of Allegan County.

Power lines were downed by winds in Mayville, and a large tree was felled in Vassar.  Gusts of 60 mph were estimated in both Owosso and Byron.  In Clio, the problem was hail; dime sized or larger hail fell for fifteen minutes.  Golfball sized hail fell on two occasions during that time period.  Large hail was also reported in parts of Tuscola County, and in southern Genesee County.A weakening area of thunderstorms moved southeast into Washtenaw and Lenawee Counties after midnight.

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.","Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $4,336,751 in public damage costs, 53 injuries, 63 homes destroyed, 1196 homes damaged, 15 businesses destroyed, and 173 businesses damaged in Kent County, excluding the City of Grand Rapids (see separate Grand Rapids report). Private damage costs were estimated to be approximately $45.0 Million in the city of Walker alone. No other private damage costs were available from across the county. The storm damage was most severe in the cities of Rockford and Walker. Most city streets within the city limits of Rockford and Walker were left impassable. The city of Walker was closed to the public. Michigan State Police troopers assisted the city of Walker with security and a dawn to dusk curfew was enforced. A team from the Michigan National Guard was sent to the city of Walker to assist in debris removal and cleanup operations. Most of Walker was left without power as the power line infrastructure was destroyed. Damaged and destroyed businesses left 8,403 people unemployed. The Kent County fruitbelt, covering much of the northwest part of the county, received an estimated $20.0 Million in damages due to snapped and uprooted trees. Most damage was done to apple trees, but cherry and peach orchards were also damaged. Kent County declared a local state of emergency (as did the city of Walker) and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county.

Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.

One of these storms developed into a supercell over southern Barry County. This supercell thunderstorm propagated east-southeast across Calhoun and Jackson Counties from approximately 4:20 pm until 5:45 pm EDT and spawned an F1 tornado and two damaging microbursts. The microburst which hit Pennfield Township in Calhoun County killed a 75-year old male and injured 2 females (one of which, a 13-year old female, was critically injured) when their respective modular homes were destroyed. NWS Grand Rapids officials estimated wind speeds reached 120 mph in the Pennfield Township downburst. The tornado did not result in any deaths or injuries, but did approximately $50,000 in damage just south of Bedford in Calhoun County.	Overall, downed trees and power lines and lightning strikes knocked out power to 22,000 in southern Michigan, most of which occurred in Barry, Calhoun, and Wayne Counties (in southeast Lower Michigan).","Damage surveys conducted by the National Weather Service with the assistance of the Civil Air Patrol and Calhoun County Emergency Management confirmed a brief tornado touchdown occurred in Bedford Township of northwest Calhoun County at 4:34 pm EDT on Friday, June 12th. The tornado touched down in a low wooded area near Kirby Lake, 2 miles southwest of the village of Bedford. The tornado crossed Collier Road and travelled along Halbert Road and caused extensive damage to trees from Wanbascon Creek to about 3/4 of a mile east of Michigan Highway 37. The storm path length was approximately 2.5 statute miles long and up to 600 feet (or 200 yards) wide. It appeared that most of the tornadic winds remained aloft, clipping the upper half of trees like a large weed wacker. Scattered homes in the area received minor damage consisting of broken windows, TV antennas bent over roof tops, and damage to shingles and siding. A few homes sustained roof damage as the result of trees and large limbs being blown down on the dwellings. Based on the estimates from the damage survey in Bedford Township, this particular tornado was rated F1 (73-112mph) on the Fujita Scale. The tornado lifted approximately 4 minutes after touching down as the storm continued to move east-southeast into Pennfield Township. No injuries or fatalities were reported as a direct result of this tornado touchdown. Parts of Michigan Highway 37 were closed for a time after the storm to clear away downed trees and power lines.",1998,6

One of these storms developed into a supercell over southern Barry County. This supercell thunderstorm propagated east-southeast across Calhoun and Jackson Counties from approximately 4:20 pm until 5:45 pm EDT and spawned an F1 tornado and two damaging microbursts. The microburst which hit Pennfield Township in Calhoun County killed a 75-year old male and injured 2 females (one of which, a 13-year old female, was critically injured) when their respective modular homes were destroyed. NWS Grand Rapids officials estimated wind speeds reached 120 mph in the Pennfield Township downburst. The tornado did not result in any deaths or injuries, but did approximately $50,000 in damage just south of Bedford in Calhoun County.	Overall, downed trees and power lines and lightning strikes knocked out power to 22,000 in southern Michigan, most of which occurred in Barry, Calhoun, and Wayne Counties (in southeast Lower Michigan).","The same supercell thunderstorm which produced the F1 tornado in northwest Calhoun County produced a wet microburst as it moved across Pennfield Township. The downburst caused one fatality and 2 injuries approximately 1/2 mile south of Pennfield High School, just east of the Battle Creek River in the vicinity of Pony Street and Clarence Blvd. Approximately 12 homes sustained varying degrees of damage in this location. Two modular homes on adjacent properties along Clarence Blvd. were blown off their foundations and destroyed. A 75 year old man in the northernmost structure was killed, while a teenage girl who occupied the neighboring home was critically injured and her mother sustained minor injuries. A 20 foot camping trailer was hurled in a grove of small trees over 100 feet away and was demolished. In addition, several vehicles were damaged. A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Office in Grand Rapids revealed a unidirectional damage pattern associated with straight-line winds.

A well-defined outflow boundary and squall line developed ahead of a weakening Mesoscale Convective System during the evening of the 28th. This outflow boundary and squall line moved east across Lake Michigan and onshore across West Central and Southwest Lower Michigan shortly after Midnight EDT and crossed the Lower Peninsula by 5:00 am EDT. Downburst (wet microbursts) wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were common with the thunderstorms and downed trees and power lines caused most of the associated damage. Only a few hail reports were received. The worst of the damage occurred in Muskegon County and the northwest corner of Ottawa County, including the cities of Muskegon and Grand Haven. Especially hard-hit was the cities of North Muskegon, Muskegon, and Norton Shores, were hundreds of homes received minor damage from fallen trees and power lines. The power line infrastructure in the Muskegon area was greatly damaged, resulting loss of power for approximately 33% of the county's residents. Overall, an estimated 90,000 people lost power across the state, with 54,000 of the customers located in Muskegon County alone.

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.

Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.",,1998,7

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.

However, isolated occurrences of 60 to 80 mph wind gusts downed trees and power lines at scattered locations across mainly the western two tiers of counties across southwest Lower Michigan, between Muskegon and Benton Harbor. The peak wind gust reported was 81 mph in Saugatuck, along the lake shore of Allegan County. At the height of the storm, approximately 13,400 people were without power in areas near and around Muskegon, Montague, Holland, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, and Battle Creek. Many power outages were caused by lightning strikes.",Amateur radio operators reported power lines downed near the intersection of Plainfield Ave and 4 Mile Road in NE Grand Rapids. A trained spotter reported one tree was uprooted at a funeral home at the corner of Fuller St. and 3 Mile Road in NE Grand Rapids. No structural damage was reported.,1998,6

Thunderstorms near both boundaries became severe.Storms near the northern boundary were hail producers.  Golfball sized hail was reported by a spotter in Sanford, and also by the Michigan State Police northwest of Pinconning.  Dime to quarter sized hail was reported at a number of other locations in Midland and Bay Counties.Along the warm front, a large supercell developed in south-central Michigan.  It moved east and then turned southeast across southeast Michigan.  Hardest hit was Washtenaw County, most notably around Chelsea, and from Milan to Whittaker.  These locations were affected by parts of the supercell for an extended period of time.  Severe weather started in the area around and north of Chelsea, where golfball sized hail fell.  A lightning strike started a house fire north of Chelsea.  Quarter sized hail fell in Chelsea about 20 minutes later, but this part of the storm was more noted for the wind damage it caused.  Trees were downed in Sylvan, Chelsea, and Lima.  A truck was destroyed by a fallen tree in Sylvan, and a few homes in Chelsea were damaged in a similar manner.  Wind gusts also destroyed in barn in Lima.  The wind was estimated at 75 mph in Chelsea.The supercell covered the Milan-Whittaker area with golfball sized hail.  A spotter in Whittaker estimated 70 mph winds.  Again, a second component of the large supercell caused severe weather 15 to 20 minutes later.  This one also produced golfball sized hail in Milan, and emergency management officials estimated 70 mph winds just west of Whittaker.Although not hit as hard, the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area also saw severe weather.  A spotter in Ann Arbor estimated 60 mph winds on the fringe of the supercell, while a spotter in Ypsilanti saw golfball sized hail and 75 mph winds.  Another spotter in Pittsfield saw dime sized hail.The supercell continued southeast into Lenawee and Monroe Counties.  Only the northeast corner of Lenawee County was grazed, as trees were downed near Macon.  Monroe County took a more substantial hit.  A golfer at Thorn Hills Golf Club, northeast of Maybee, was hurt when a large tree limb fell on him.  Trees were also downed in Dundee and Raisinville Township.  A spotter estimated 60 mph winds in Maybee, as did emergency management officials just south of Carleton.  Dime sized hail fell at the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant.

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).

Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.

Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.",,1998,5

The approach of an upper level jet allowed some thunderstorms to persist well past midnight.During the evening, severe thunderstorms sporadically produced large hail and damaging winds.  Power lines were downed by winds in Mayville, and a large tree was felled in Vassar.  Gusts of 60 mph were estimated in both Owosso and Byron.  In Clio, the problem was hail; dime sized or larger hail fell for fifteen minutes.  Golfball sized hail fell on two occasions during that time period.  Large hail was also reported in parts of Tuscola County, and in southern Genesee County.A weakening area of thunderstorms moved southeast into Washtenaw and Lenawee Counties after midnight.  These storms were still potent enough to generate severe wind gusts in the western parts of these counties.  Trees were downed in Dexter, Addison, north of Chelsea, and just west of Ann Arbor.  Law enforcement estimated a 60 mph gust near Manchester.  These storms weakened below severe limits as they continued east.",,1998,6

A weak area of low pressure was moving slowly east along the front, in response to a strong shortwave approaching the area.  A very moist and unstable airmass was across the region, and a number of thunderstorms developed as a result.  The stationary front acted as a focusing mechanism, allowing thunderstorms to move repeatedly over the same area.Heavy rain occurred in a band from just east of Ypsilanti to east of Flat Rock, where an average of 2 to 3 inches of rain fell during the evening.  This rain was not enough to cause significant flooding, although some standing water developed in places with poor drainage.  However, a small area within this band saw substantially more rainfall.  The heaviest rain fell near the intersection of Interstate 275 and Eureka Road, on the southwest edge of Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Radar estimated 4.9 inches of rainfall near this location.  On Metro Airport proper, 4.34 inches of rain fell.The resultant flash flooding caused substantial damage to the Davey Terminal at Metro Airport.  The baggage handling area was flooded with 3 feet of water.  In the parking area outside, water 6 feet deep floated some cars.  An electrical room inside the terminal was flooded, cutting power to 19 gates.  About fifty Northwest Airlines flights had to be cancelled as a result of the flooding and electrical outage, and as Metro Airport is the largest hub for that airline, the effects rippled across the country.Flash flooding also occurred in the suburban communities around the airport.  Some primary roads on the west side of Taylor were closed for hours, including Beech Daly and Monroe.  Three feet of water covered parts of Telegraph Road (US-24) near Interstate 94.

This storm occurred on the 23rd anniversary of the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald in Lake Superior, and was actually very comparable to that storm, both in regards to storm intensity and storm track.  The big story with both systems were the extremely strong winds that occurred.  Thankfully, this storm - as opposed to the Fitzgerald storm - was forecast days in advance, and the huge majority of marine traffic on the Great Lakes sought safe harbor before wind speeds became excessive.High winds occurred in two phases.  Winds reached high wind criteria across southeast Michigan early in the afternoon of the 10th, associated with a cold front racing east across the state.  A line of showers accompanied the front, locally enhancing wind speeds (see below).  The strong winds slackened some during the afternoon.  Wind speeds increased again in the evening, as an area of strong descent well behind the cold front allowed strong winds aloft to penetrate to ground level.  The highest winds during the entire event occurred within a couple of hours of midnight.  Winds diminished to below high wind criteria by dawn on the 11 th.Both periods of high winds caused significant damage across the area.  In the afternoon, the walls of a church under construction were destroyed in Troy.  A warehouse in Flint was deroofed, and a second warehouse roof was damaged.  Large tree limbs were downed in Saginaw.  Wind speeds approaching 50 mph were measured at the Coast Guard Station in Port Huron.Damage was more widespread with the higher wind speeds that occurred at night.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed across all of southeast Michigan.  The falling trees and limbs caused damage to some homes and vehicles.  In Livingston County, an indirect fatality occurred, as the driver of a car was killed when he crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road.  In Owosso, a roof under construction collapsed, and a church under construction in Ida (Monroe County) was also damaged.  An automated weather observing station in Adrian was disabled.  Near Mt Clemens, a boat rack storing a number boats of collapsed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.  A 70 mph wind gust was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake at about 1020 pm.The extended period of strong winds caused an interesting phenomena on Saginaw Bay.  Southwest gales occurred over the waters of Saginaw Bay for 12 to 18 hours, acting to push water out of the bay and into the main body of Lake Huron.  Water levels in Saginaw Bay dropped dramatically as a result.  Previous to the storm, the water level was running about 18 inches above chart datum.  Any level lower than about 4 inches above chart datum begins to interfere with navigation on Saginaw Bay.  At about 5 am on the 11th, the water level on Saginaw Bay bottomed out at an amazing 50 inches below chart datum - over 5 feet below the recent average!  Although detailed historical records were not available for this writing, the Coast Guard in Essexville (Bay County) reported that this was the lowest water level in recent memory.  Most of Saginaw Bay is quite shallow, and the removal of over 5 feet of water exposed a huge portion of the bay bed; some estimate that up to half of the area of the bay briefly became dry land during the storm!  To illustrate this point, a pair of duck hunters were stranded on an island off of Sebewaing (Huron County), as the water level dropped too far for them to be able to boat back to the mainland.  However, as the water level dropped further during the night, one of the hunters was able to walk ashore, as the intervening three miles of Saginaw Bay suddenly became dry land.  As the wind slackened and swung to the west toward dawn, the water level began to rise toward a more normal level.",,1998,1

Strong southerly flow ahead of the low advected high amounts of moisture toward the Great Lakes from the Gulf of Mexico.  Rain fell occasionally on the 16th, 17, and 18th.  In southeast Michigan, the heaviest rain occurred in the Detroit area on the 17th.  Rainfall totals during the three days were commonly over two inches, most of that falling from about 10 am to 6 pm EST on the 17th.  Some of the higher rainfall amounts over the three days were: 2.85 inches in Dundee, 2.55 inches in Adrian, 2.48 inches in Mt Clemens, 2.65 inches in Grosse Pointe Farms, and 2.69 inches in Dearborn.  Detroit Metropolitan Airport recorded 2.81 inches over the three days, of which 2.24 inches fell on the 17th.  Average rainfall for the entire month of February at Detroit is 1.74 inches. The resulting flooding hit hardest in eastern Monroe County, where lakeshore flooding exacerbated runoff problems.  East winds gusted as high as 45 mph, pushing the Lake Erie water level to 3.5 feet above normal at Luna Pier.  This water level was the highest in recent memory according to area residents, and was topped by 6 foot waves on the night of the 17th.  The high water and pounding surf destroyed two private docks in Luna Pier, and flooded many roads near the lakeshore.  In addition, the abnormally high lake levels prevented effective runoff further inland.  As a result, some flooding of roads and basements occurred across all of Monroe County.Urban flooding was a significant problem in parts of Wayne County.  Hundreds of basements and many streets were flooded in the cities west and southwest of Detroit.  A state of emergency was declared for much of Wayne County. Taylor, Dearborn Heights, Westland, and Grosse Ile were among the hardest hit communities.  High water briefly closed the Southfield Freeway just north of Interstate 94.In Macomb County, Warren, St. Clair Shores, and Clinton Township were among the communities that experienced urban and lowland flooding.  Again the most common problems were basement and road flooding.  Lakeshore flooding from Lake St. Clair closed some roads all along the Macomb County shoreline, but problems here were not as severe as further south in Monroe County.Limited flooding occurred in St. Clair and Oakland Counties.  A few roads were closed in southern St. Clair County due to high water.  A few roads and basements flooded in southern Oakland County, most notably in the Farmington area.Runoff caused several area rivers to exceed flood stage (see below).",,1998,2

In Allen Park, 14 homes experienced some flooding.Four to six inches of snow fell in Bay County on the 9th.  The highest snowfall total, six inches, was recorded seven miles west of Linwood, near the community of Crump.Strong north winds occurred during the storm's closest approach on the 9th.  A few trees were downed along the Tuscola County shoreline, seven miles northwest of Akron, as these winds came off of Saginaw Bay.  Later in the morning, the wind downed power lines in Flint, Burton, Davison, Otisville, and Swartz Creek.",,1998,3
