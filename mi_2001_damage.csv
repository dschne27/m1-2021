A strong upper level disturbance was also present over the Great Lakes.  Widespread snow showers were the result, with lake enhancement occurring near Lake Huron.  Though all of southeast Michigan received snow, the shoreline counties of the Thumb got the worst of it.  Four inches of snow fell in Port Hope, Marlette, and Port Huron.  Accidents near Water Street caused I-94 in Port Huron to be closed briefly.The snow fell in showers, which were intense at times.  Near white-out conditions were reported occasionally across much of southeast Michigan, thanks to a combination of falling snow and a gusty north wind.  I-94 near and west of Ann Arbor saw numerous accidents, as a significant snow squall moved through during the late afternoon commute.  The snow melted and refroze, producing very icy conditions.  The same hazards were found on US-23.  A 56-car pileup on southbound US-23 just north of Ann Arbor closed that freeway for more than 3 hours, beginning just after 5 pm.

An amputee organization was having a golf outing that afternoon.  Thankfully, the golf carts were equipped with G.P.S. units, and the course sent a message out on those units that a tornado was approaching.  Only one person on the course suffered a minor injury (exact injury undisclosed).  Three homes were destroyed near Clyde Road and US-23, as were a party store and a towing company that shared a building.  A man at the party store suffered a minor hand injury, and two vehicles at the towing company were totaled.

This ridge prevented the development of widespread thunderstorms, and prevented rainfall from moving into the region from the west. While there was occasional isolated thunderstorms, much of the region suffered a pronounced dry spell. The lack of rainfall put a hardship on the area's water supply and measures were taken to curb usage. This included prohibiting outdoor watering in many communities in Macomb, Washtenaw, Genesee, Oakland, and Wayne counties. During the five week period ending July 28th, Detroit Metro Airport officially reported only 0.32 inches of rainfall. This became Detroits 11th driest month on record. With 1.59 inches, this was Flint's 10th driest month on record. In contrast to July, April through early June saw slightly above normal precipitation. This wet spring delayed planting of crops and resulted in shallower than normal rooting systems for crops already established. By mid summer, however, the upper air pattern changed and rainfall waned. In terms of timing, the drought impacted many summer crops during moisture-sensitive growth stages of greatest water need, leading to moisture stress which peaked by mid August. It was estimated that yields of corn, dry beans and soybeans were 1/3 from normal. Rains returned to the region in mid and late August. Too late, however, to reverse the negative effects from mid summer. At the date of this publishing, an estimate dollar amount of damage to area crops is unknown.",,2001,7

This ridge prevented the development of widespread thunderstorms, and prevented rainfall from moving into the region from the west. While there was occasional isolated thunderstorms, much of the region suffered a pronounced dry spell. The lack of rainfall put a hardship on the area's water supply and measures were taken to curb usage. This included prohibiting outdoor watering in many communities in Macomb, Washtenaw, Genesee, Oakland, and Wayne counties. During the five week period ending July 28th, Detroit Metro Airport officially reported only 0.32 inches of rainfall. This became Detroits 11th driest month on record. With 1.59 inches, this was Flint's 10th driest month on record. In contrast to July, April through early June saw slightly above normal precipitation. This wet spring delayed planting of crops and resulted in shallower than normal rooting systems for crops already established. By mid summer, however, the upper air pattern changed and rainfall waned. In terms of timing, the drought impacted many summer crops during moisture-sensitive growth stages of greatest water need, leading to moisture stress which peaked by mid August. It was estimated that yields of corn, dry beans and soybeans were 1/3 from normal. Rains returned to the region in mid and late August. Too late, however, to reverse the negative effects from mid summer. At the date of this publishing, an estimate dollar amount of damage to area crops is unknown.",,2001,7

The lack of rainfall put a hardship on the area's water supply and measures were taken to curb usage. This included prohibiting outdoor watering in many communities in Macomb, Washtenaw, Genesee, Oakland, and Wayne counties.

With 1.59 inches, this was Flint's 10th driest month on record. In contrast to July, April through early June saw slightly above normal precipitation. This wet spring delayed planting of crops and resulted in shallower than normal rooting systems for crops already established. By mid summer, however, the upper air pattern changed and rainfall waned. In terms of timing, the drought impacted many summer crops during moisture-sensitive growth stages of greatest water need, leading to moisture stress which peaked by mid August.

The lack of rainfall put a hardship on the area's water supply and measures were taken to curb usage. This included prohibiting outdoor watering in many communities in Macomb, Washtenaw, Genesee, Oakland, and Wayne counties. During the five week period ending July 28th, Detroit Metro Airport officially reported only 0.32 inches of rainfall. This became Detroits 11th driest month on record. With 1.59 inches, this was Flint's 10th driest month on record. In contrast to July, April through early June saw slightly above normal precipitation. This wet spring delayed planting of crops and resulted in shallower than normal rooting systems for crops already established. By mid summer, however, the upper air pattern changed and rainfall waned. In terms of timing, the drought impacted many summer crops during moisture-sensitive growth stages of greatest water need, leading to moisture stress which peaked by mid August. It was estimated that yields of corn, dry beans and soybeans were 1/3 from normal. Rains returned to the region in mid and late August.

Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare.

Detroit also broke a record on the 8th when a high of 99 degrees was reached. In addition to the heat, humidity levels rose significantly during the time period. The high heat and humidity allowed daytime heat indices to exceed 100 degrees four days in a row. In fact, heat advisories were in effect for all of southeast Michigan for the afternoons and evenings of the 7th, 8th, and 9th. During this time period, heat indices ranged from 105 to 110 degrees.The heat caused several people to seek emergency care for heat stroke and heat exhaustion. One fatality also occurred due to the heat when an Oak Park man was found suffering from severe heat exhaustion while locked in his car. Several hours later, he was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The hot weather only aggravated the dry conditions already in place across southeast Lower Michigan (see July for more details). This led to tremendous worries among area farmers that they may loose entire crops. Thousands of power outages also occurred throughout the region as demand surpassed supply. Several factory workers across the area were sent home from work to escape the extreme heat.

Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event.

During this time period, heat indices ranged from 105 to 110 degrees.The heat caused several people to seek emergency care for heat stroke and heat exhaustion. One fatality also occurred due to the heat when an Oak Park man was found suffering from severe heat exhaustion while locked in his car. Several hours later, he was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The hot weather only aggravated the dry conditions already in place across southeast Lower Michigan (see July for more details). This led to tremendous worries among area farmers that they may loose entire crops. Thousands of power outages also occurred throughout the region as demand surpassed supply. Several factory workers across the area were sent home from work to escape the extreme heat. Many of those who were not, however, threatened to walk off the job as a result of not having air conditioning in their factories.",,2001,8

During this time period, heat indices ranged from 105 to 110 degrees.The heat caused several people to seek emergency care for heat stroke and heat exhaustion. One fatality also occurred due to the heat when an Oak Park man was found suffering from severe heat exhaustion while locked in his car. Several hours later, he was pronounced dead at an area hospital. The hot weather only aggravated the dry conditions already in place across southeast Lower Michigan (see July for more details). This led to tremendous worries among area farmers that they may loose entire crops. Thousands of power outages also occurred throughout the region as demand surpassed supply.

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in.

Ahead of this cold front, unseasonably warm air surged northward into the Great Lakes. Thunderstorms developed ahead of the cold front late in the afternoon of the 24th and continued into the evening. These thunderstorms extended from the Great Lakes all the way to the deep south. Strong winds just off the surface allowed some of the thunderstorms that developed across southern Michigan to become severe. Most of the severe storms caused damaging winds gusts associated with strait line microburst winds. However, increased low level directional shear via a surface warm front that extended across southeast Michigan allowed some of the thunderstorms to develop rotation, a few of which produced tornadoes. Three tornadoes were spawned from the thunderstorms. However, since two of the tornadoes crossed a county border, five tornadoes will officially be recorded with this event. This is considered an unusual event since tornadoes in late October in Southeast Michigan are extremely rare. Following the passage of the cold front early on the morning of the 25th, winds gusting as high as 45 MPH affected the region and dropped temperatures 20 to 30 degrees.","The Bay County tornado moved into Tuscola County near Darbee Road in Gilford Township.

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs. The storm blew over and damaged quonset huts utilized for storage at Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing. Only minor additional damage was reported as the storm moved across extreme southeast Clinton county. The third supercell storm began near Tekonsha in south central Calhoun county. It moved northeast between 50 and 55 m.p.h. across Calhoun, northwest Jackson and Ingham county. It produced winds to 90 m.p.h. in Tekonsha where it destroyed a number of mobile homes, causing injuries to 6 people. The storm produced mainly tree damage and minor structural damage along the remainder of it's track, and also blew down a barn just north of Webberville in Ingham county.

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs. The storm blew over and damaged quonset huts utilized for storage at Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing. Only minor additional damage was reported as the storm moved across extreme southeast Clinton county. The third supercell storm began near Tekonsha in south central Calhoun county. It moved northeast between 50 and 55 m.p.h. across Calhoun, northwest Jackson and Ingham county. It produced winds to 90 m.p.h. in Tekonsha where it destroyed a number of mobile homes, causing injuries to 6 people. The storm produced mainly tree damage and minor structural damage along the remainder of it's track, and also blew down a barn just north of Webberville in Ingham county.

This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs.
