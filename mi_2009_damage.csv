There was a successive failure of 32 power poles on a north-south powerline about 1 mile west of Leslie.  Speaking with an engineer on the scene, his  thought was that the wooden poles were not quite robust enough to handle the weight of the 6 conductors and that the failure was preceeded by one or two poles that had started to lean due to wet ground conditions over the past several months.  The thunderstorm wind gust was then enough to overload one of the leaning poles causing it to snap near its base.  The falling pole then pulled on adjacent poles initiating a cascading failure both north and south of the initial failure.  The cascading failure was witnessed by a nearby resident.  The wooden poles were being replaced with steel towers.",2009,4
