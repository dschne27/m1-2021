Schools and a few  businesses were closed in Gogebic, Ontonagon, Baraga and Marquette counties and some roads were blocked in Houghton and Keweenaw counties.The snow was wet and heavy, breaking off tree branches and downing power and telephone lines and hampering plowing and cleanup efforts. Roads were slick and hazardous, restricting travel across the area.",,2003,1

Gulf of Mexico moisture moving over the warm front associated with this low brought  snow to western and central Upper Michigan. Enough warm air moved into the Upper Peninsula to change the snow over to sleet then to freezing rain and drizzle.  The combination of 3 to 4 inches of sleet and wet snow and 1/4 inch of ice accumulation from freezing rain and drizzle shut down the county airport in Houghton and made roads in Northern Houghton and Keweenaw counties extremely slick and hazardous. There were reports of power and telephone outages as the weight of the freezing and frozen precipitation broke off tree branches and brought down power and telephone lines.,,2003,1

This front dropped temperatures to the freezing mark generally along and north of a Brighton to St Clair Shores line. Then, a series of low pressure systems moved across the front. This allowed very warm and moist air to lift north overtop of the sub-freezing temperatures near the ground. The first wave of precipitation moved across eastern Michigan late in the evening on April 3rd and continued through the morning of April 4th. Thunderstorms brought heavy freezing rain to the area during this time period. Spotter reports indicated up to 3 inches of freezing rain occurred in some places. Sleet was also reported across much of the Saginaw Valley. By the afternoon of April 4th, ice accumulations of one quarter to three quarters of an inch were reported across the area. The Saginaw Valley even had one to two inches of sleet accumulations in addition to the ice. After a break in the precipitation during the afternoon of the 4th, a second round of thunderstorms brought freezing rain and sleet to the area during the evening of April 4th, finally ending early in the morning of April 5th. By the morning of the 5th, ice accumulations ranged from one half to one inch. Sleet had also accumulated up to two inches in and around Flint and the Saginaw Valley. Since the road and ground surfaces were warmed due to very warm weather the later half of March, most of the ice accumulations occurred on elevated surfaces, like trees and power lines. The ice accumulations led to considerable tree damage and widespread power outages across the entire area. Locations hardest hit, with around an inch of ice reported on the trees, were across northern Oakland County, northern Macomb County, and throughout Lapeer, St Clair, Sanilac and Huron counties. In these areas, the tree damage was so severe that dozens of roads were blocked by trees and damage occurred to hundreds of homes, businesses and automobiles as tree limbs, or in many cases large trees themselves, were brought to the ground under the weight of the ice. It was estimated that 450,000 homes and businesses lost power during the storm.

Very warm and humid air pushed into the region ahead of this front. This triggered widespread thunderstorms during the afternoon, some of which produced severe wind gusts and large hail. A much stronger line of thunderstorms then passed through the region during the early evening hours. This line of thunderstorms accompanied the passage of the cold front. The strongest of these storms occurred south and east of an Owosso to Bad Axe line, many of which were accompanied by severe wind gusts.  An estimated 10,000 homes and businesses reportedly lost power during the storms. Thunderstorm winds were also responsible for blowing down a 200-foot electricity tower in Ontario, Canada, just across the St Clair River from Marysville. The tower fell onto the river.

Wind gusts of 55 to 60 mph were estimated across much of Wayne and Washtenaw counties. The rest of Eastern Michigan generally had estimated wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. The winds caused several trees to blow down across the area. In Riverview (Wayne County), the roof, sunroof, and windshield of a luxury car was damaged when a flagpole blew down on top of it. A light pole in Allen Park was blown down, which knocked the power out of a storm pump station. This resulted in the flooding of some overpasses in the city. A large tree fell on top of a parked vehicle in the city of Detroit. The strong winds were also blamed for a hydrochloric acid leak from Marsh Planting Corp. in Ypsilanti. Investigators concluded that the high winds ripped a chunk of the plant's roof loose, smashing it into a distribution pipe, which caused roughly 100 gallons of acid to leak out.

The best storm of the night got organized from another batch of activity along the Ohio border and formed into a nice supercell right on the Lenawee/Monroe county line.Although instability was initially minimized by morning cloud cover on the 21st, sunshine was able to filter through a thinning cirrus canopy by early afternoon.

This activity intensified as it moved into areas along and south of I 94 by early evening. A small bow echo eventually formed as this convective line tracked through Lenawee and Monroe counties.

The weight of the ice brought down thousands of trees and limbs and hundreds of power lines. Many people across the area lost power for several days and some people who live in outlying areas were without power for a week. The ice storm resulted in several million dollars worth of damage across the area.The ice storm came in three stages. The first period of freezing rain during the afternoon hours of the 3rd resulted in up to a quarter of an inch of ice across Osceola and Isabella counties, in central lower Michigan. The second period of freezing rain came during the nighttime hours of the 3rd into the morning hours of the 4th, when ice accumulations of a quarter to three quarters of an inch occurred across much of central lower Michigan, north of Grand Rapids.The heaviest period of freezing rain with thunderstorms came during the very late afternoon and evening hours, with the counties in the vicinity of I-96 receiving the heaviest ice accumulation. Up to an inch of ice was reported in the Lansing area, and numerous reports of a quarter to as much as an inch of ice were received in the vicinity of I-96. This was one of the biggest ice storms to affect lower Michigan in the last 50 years. When all was said and done with, most counties across central and southern lower Michigan ended up receiving a total of at least a half an inch of ice, with reports of total ice accumulation of an inch quite common, and even up to near an inch and a half of ice in some locations.",,2003,4

This front brought much cooler temperatures and strong winds to the area during the afternoon and evening. Detroit Metro Airport measured a 58 mph wind gust at 334 PM EDT. Wind gusts of 55 to 60 mph were estimated across much of Wayne and Washtenaw counties. The rest of Eastern Michigan generally had estimated wind gusts of 45 to 50 mph. The winds caused several trees to blow down across the area. In Riverview (Wayne County), the roof, sunroof, and windshield of a luxury car was damaged when a flagpole blew down on top of it. A light pole in Allen Park was blown down, which knocked the power out of a storm pump station. This resulted in the flooding of some overpasses in the city. A large tree fell on top of a parked vehicle in the city of Detroit. The strong winds were also blamed for a hydrochloric acid leak from Marsh Planting Corp. in Ypsilanti. Investigators concluded that the high winds ripped a chunk of the plant's roof loose, smashing it into a distribution pipe, which caused roughly 100 gallons of acid to leak out. The winds caused several thousand homes and businesses across the area to lose power.",,2003,5

Storms left over from the daytime were moving east along the Ohio border. An outflow boundary then moved north into Washtenaw and Wayne counties. This provided the focus for a severe storm in Washtenaw county. The best storm of the night got organized from another batch of activity along the Ohio border and formed into a nice supercell right on the Lenawee/Monroe county line.Although instability was initially minimized by morning cloud cover on the 21st, sunshine was able to filter through a thinning cirrus canopy by early afternoon. This, combined with a relatively warm and moist southwest flow, allowed temperatures to climb into the upper 70s and dewpoints to reach the mid 60s.A warm front draped along the I 69 corridor became the focus for numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon. Strong upper level winds lead to supercell development, producing damaging wind, large hail and very heavy rainfall as they moved slowly southeast into northern parts of metro Detroit by early evening.Thunderstorms also formed along a cold front in southwest Lower Michigan.

This provided the focus for a severe storm in Washtenaw county. The best storm of the night got organized from another batch of activity along the Ohio border and formed into a nice supercell right on the Lenawee/Monroe county line.Although instability was initially minimized by morning cloud cover on the 21st, sunshine was able to filter through a thinning cirrus canopy by early afternoon. This, combined with a relatively warm and moist southwest flow, allowed temperatures to climb into the upper 70s and dewpoints to reach the mid 60s.A warm front draped along the I 69 corridor became the focus for numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon. Strong upper level winds lead to supercell development, producing damaging wind, large hail and very heavy rainfall as they moved slowly southeast into northern parts of metro Detroit by early evening.Thunderstorms also formed along a cold front in southwest Lower Michigan. This activity intensified as it moved into areas along and south of I 94 by early evening. A small bow echo eventually formed as this convective line tracked through Lenawee and Monroe counties. A number of reports of wind damage were reported with this activity. All significant thunderstorm activity exited the region by around 7 pm as the cold front swept southeast of the area.",,2003,7
